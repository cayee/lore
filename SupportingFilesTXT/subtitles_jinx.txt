Jinx said to Vi: Whoa.
Jinx said to Vi: One day, I'm gonna ride in one of those things.
Jinx said to Vi: That... ...I'm ready.
Jinx said to Vi: Phew! Thanks.
Jinx said to Vi: Whoa, I think this is a real Valdiani.
Jinx said to Mylo: That's a nose hair trimmer.
Jinx said: Woo-hoo! Mm. Huh. Whoa.
Jinx said to Mylo: I don't know. I didn't do anything.
Jinx said to Mouser: Come on, Mouser, I need you!
Jinx said: No.
Jinx said to Mylo: I'm sorry. I tried to fight him off with Mouser, but... she didn't work.
Jinx said to Mylo: I tried, okay? You don't get it. You're older, you're bigger. It, it isn't fair.
Jinx said to Vander: We just heard it at Benzo's shop.
Jinx said to Vader: Little Man.
Jinx said to Vi: Whisker.
Jinx said to Vi: What's the point? I ruined everything. I always do.
Jinx said to Vi: No. Just that you were "twice the person" at half my age. You heard them. I'm not a fighter.
Jinx said to Vi: They never work.
Jinx said to Vi: What?
Jinx said to Vi: What are we doing here?
Jinx said to Vi: Uh-huh.
Jinx said to Vi: Oh, I forgot. These were in my pocket. They're from the apartment.
Jinx said to Vi: I don't know. Should we show Vander?
Jinx said: Hey, guys? You should see this...
Jinx said to Vi: Yeah, no shit.
Jinx said: We kicked the Enforcers' butts with just the four of us. Imagine what the whole of the Lanes could do.
Jinx said to Vi: Look, I made them for the Enforcers. These are smoke bombs, and those two are full of nails. They're gonna work this time, I know it.
Jinx said to Vi: Oh, you're back.
Jinx said to Vi: What?
Jinx said to Vi: I'm not afraid.
Jinx said to Vi: But families stick together. You said it yourself.
Jinx said to Vi: I want to fight. I can help.
Jinx said: I can help them.
Jinx said to Vi: Vi!
Jinx said: You have to work. For me. Okay?
Jinx said to Vi: Vi, it worked.
Jinx said to Vi: Did you see me? My monkey bomb finally worked.
Jinx said to Vi: I... I didn't... I was saving you. I only wanted to help. I only wanted to help. I only wanted to help. I only wanted to...
Jinx said to Vi: Please. Please. Please...
Jinx said to Vi: No. Why did you leave me?
Jinx said to Vi: No. No. No. No. Violet, please. Violet, please. Vi! Vi, come back! Please come back! Please, Violet. I need you. Please. Violet... Violet. Please.
Jinx said to Silco: She left me. She is not my sister anymore.
Jinx said: Hi. Vi?
Jinx said to Vi: Why did you leave me?
Jinx said to Silco: She already told you.
Jinx said to Silco: One of those Firelight wackos was a girl. With pink hair.
Jinx said to Silco: I know. I know. Sisters, right? You can't live with 'em, can't stuff 'em back in the ol' babymaker.
Jinx said to Silco: I'm sorry.
Jinx said to Silco: Phew.
Jinx said to Silco: It won't happen again.
Jinx said to Silco: Sevika? That ogre couldn't clean a dust bunny with a blowtorch.
Jinx said to Silco: Ugh.
Jinx said to Silco: I don't need time.
Jinx said to Jinx: It wasn't her. It wasn't. I know. Just... just some wannabe street trash. I got confused, that's all. Now, he thinks I'm weak. Sevika will clean it up. Sevika's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot. I'm not weak. And I'm gonna show him. Oh, I'm gonna show him. You'll see.
Jinx said: Help. In here, please. Help me. Help. It's so hot, please. I'm trapped. I'm a helpless little girl and I've set the building on fire. By accident. Totally by accident.
Jinx said: Also, I brought this dynamite. Goodbye.
Jinx said to Silco: That's me.
Jinx said to Silco: Yeah...
Jinx said to Silco: Oh, yeah.
Jinx said to Silco: Actually, I do. Happy Progress Day!
Jinx said: Boring... Boring. Wow. Super boring... Here we go! It's all about these runes.
Jinx said to Jinx: They form some kind of math-y, magic-y gateway. To the realm of heebie-jeebies. And this... Turns it on. So... here goes. No! No! It was a mistake! It was a mistake.
Jinx said to Silco: I can't do it. Just... give it to the doctor.
Jinx said to Silco: I keep... seeing them. That day.
Jinx said to Silco: You told me a million times.
Jinx said to Silco: Right, he was like a brother to you, and he turned his back and blah, blah, blah. Did I miss anything?
Jinx said to Thieram: Chuck!
Jinx said to Thieram: Nice try, Chuck. What's all the hubbub?
Jinx said to Thieram: Someone? Anyone? Who are you grabbing?
Jinx said to Thieram: Focus. Who are they? Why wasn't I invited to the party?
Jinx said to Thieram: Oh really? Which number?
Jinx said to Thieram: You're doing great, Chuck. Here, for your troubles.
Jinx said to Sevika: Lost who? I feel like you and I got off on the wrong arm. Maybe we should try the other.
Jinx said to Sevika: You're lying!
Jinx said to Sevika: Ten outta ten, toots! I think I know just how to deliver that message.
Jinx said to Vi: Vi?
Jinx said to Vi: Marcus?
Jinx said to Vi: Are you real?
Jinx said to Vi: Things changed when you left. I changed.
Jinx said to Vi: Who's she?
Jinx said to Vi: Sevika wasn't lying? You're with an enforcer?
Jinx said to Vi: This is a trick! You're playing me!
Jinx said to Jinx: Shut up! I'm in no mood.
Jinx said to Caitlyn: I wasn't talking to you!
Jinx said to Vi: Stop calling me that. It's Jinx now. Powder fell down a well.
Jinx said to Vi: Stop talking to me like I'm a child! Was that why you came? For this stupid stone?
Jinx said to Vi: You're a class act, Sister. Sister. Thought I missed her. Bet you wouldn't miss her.
Jinx said to Jinx: Everyone, shut up, I need to think.
Jinx said to Vi: Do you hear that?
Jinx said to Mylo: I didn't lose her! They took her. She was there for me! Not the enforcer. Why would I remember her name? Well, she's just some stupid topsider! Caitlyn. Pow.
Jinx said to Silco: Let me help you with that.
Jinx said to Silco: Oh, you know. Here, there, chasing down dead ends. And guess what? They're not all dead.
Jinx said to Silco: Don't move, silly. I might hurt you.
Jinx said to Silco: But you found out she came back. You lied.
Jinx said to Silco: From what?
Jinx said to Mylo: Shut up. It's just a goodbye hug. She wouldn't do that. Not again.
Jinx said to Vi: Liar.
Jinx said to Ekko: Oh, look who it is. The boy savior. Hah. Yes! No.
Jinx said: Vi? No! No, no. No!
Jinx said: No!
Jinx said: Wait! No!
Jinx said to Vi: Bravo, sis.
Jinx said: Really thought I buried this place. But I should have known better.
Jinx said: Nothing ever stays dead.
Jinx said to Vi: For now. Maybe forever. Wanna know a secret? Silco thinks he made Jinx, with all his rants and his hard-won lessons. Excise your doubts, Jinx. Be what they fear, Jinx. Like everything was the same as when Vander left him. But he didn't make Jinx. You did.
Jinx said to Vi: You never left. I always heard you. Shadows in the streets, prickles on the back of my neck. Your voice. Pushing me. Picking me up when all the colors were black. You're the reason I'm still alive.
Jinx said to Vi: Are we still sisters?
Jinx said to Vi: I always knew you'd come back.
Jinx said to Vi: He took everything from us. Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back. Just like he planned to do with me.
Jinx said to Silco: Liar.
Jinx said: Mm. We're missing someone.
Jinx said to Vi: I paid your girlfriend a visit this morning.
Jinx said to Vi: I made her a snack.
Jinx said to Vi: Sheesh. I'm not that crazy.
Jinx said: Now...
Jinx said to Vi: Where should I sit? That's your choice, really. Make her go away. Please. Send her on her way and... And you can have Powder back.
Jinx said: Ah.
Jinx said to Vi: Where would we go?
Jinx said to Jinx: No, no, no. She's not saying that.
Jinx said to Silco: What do you have to say about that?
Jinx said: Mm-hmm.
Jinx said to Vi: You aren't lying? You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.
Jinx said to Jinx: Shut up! We're talking!
Jinx said to Vi: Stop.
Jinx said: No!
Jinx said to Silco: No... Oh. Oh, no, no, no. I'm sorry... I'm sorry. I'm sorry. I'm sorry.
Jinx said to Vi: I thought maybe you could love me like you used to. Even though I'm... different. But you changed too. So... Here's to the new us.
