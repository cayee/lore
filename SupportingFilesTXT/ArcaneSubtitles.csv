1,Vi,Mylo,We're almost there.
1,Mylo,Vi,"Aw, man."
1,Vi,Jinx,"Hey, Powder."
1,Vi,Jinx,Come take a look.
1,Jinx,Vi,Whoa.
1,Vi,Jinx,"It's nice getting above it all, huh?"
1,Jinx,Vi,"One day, I'm gonna ride in one of those things."
1,Mylo,Vi,"And one day, I'm gonna shoot one of 'em down."
1,Mylo,Vi,"Vi, are, are you sure about this?"
1,Claggor,Vi,"Look, if we get caught, we're..."
1,Vi,Claggor,We're not gonna get caught.
1,Vi,Claggor,We'll be in and out before anyone notices.
1,Vi,Mylo,"All right, everybody, follow me. Just don't look down."
1,Claggor,Vi,Couldn't we have at least just walked there?
1,Vi,Mylo,Gotta stay out of sight for this one.
1,,,Called it.
1,,,"This is on you, Vi."
1,Claggor,Vi,I'll get her.
1,Vi,Claggor,No.
1,Vi,Jinx,"Powder, look at me."
1,Vi,Jinx,What did I tell you?
1,Jinx,Vi,That...
1,Jinx,Vi,...I'm ready.
1,Vi,Jinx,That's right! So?
1,Jinx,Vi,Phew!
1,Jinx,Vi,Thanks.
1,Claggor,Vi,What if Vander finds out we're all the way up here?
1,Vi,Claggor,Look around you.
1,Vi,Claggor,You think anyone topside's going hungry?
1,Vi,Claggor,"Besides, this is exactly the sort of job Vander would've pulled when he was our age."
1,Vi,Claggor,I'm going. Are you with me or not?
1,Claggor,Vi,Vander's gonna kill us.
1,Vi,Claggor,"Yeah, only if we screw up."
1,Vi,Claggor,So don't screw up.
1,Vi,Mylo,All clear.
1,,,Who locks their balcony?
1,,,Hmm.
1,,,Whew.
1,Claggor,Vi,There's tons of enforcers down there.
1,Vi,Claggor,Means we're in the right place.
1,Vi,Claggor,You gonna get that door open any time soon?
1,Mylo,Vi,Working on it.
1,,,"Seeing as I'm the only one who knows how to pick locks,"
1,,,I suggest...
1,,,Animals.
1,Mylo,Claggor,"You know, Claggor, for once you're right."
1,Mylo,Claggor,We are definitely not supposed to be here.
1,,,Hmm.
1,Vi,,Must be an inventor.
1,,,Huh.
1,Jinx,Vi,"Whoa, I think this is a real Valdiani."
1,Mylo,Jinx,"Oh, yeah? What about this?"
1,Jinx,Mylo,That's a nose hair trimmer.
1,Vi,Jinx,"Keep an eye out for anything that looks valuable, Powder."
1,Vi,Jinx,Before Mylo fills the bag with junk.
1,,,Uh... guys?
1,,,"Wait, Vi, how the hell did we find this place?"
1,Vi,Claggor,It was a tip from Little Man.
1,,,Little Man?
1,Vi,Claggor,Just leave it.
1,,,Come on.
1,,,How can anyone have so much stuff?
1,,,"Simple, just get born lucky."
1,Jinx,,Woo-hoo!
1,Jinx,,Mm.
1,Jinx,,Huh.
1,Jinx,,Whoa.
1,Vi,Mylo,Mylo.
1,Vi,Jinx,"Powder, we gotta go."
1,,,Hello?
1,,,Is someone in there?
1,Vi,Jinx,Come on.
1,Vi,Mylo,We'll be fine. Just get back on the roof.
1,Vi,Jinx,Hold on!
1,,,Whoa! Look out!
1,,,Watch out!
1,,,Hey.
1,Vi,,Shit.
1,,,Stop right there!
1,,,Get them off!
1,Vi,Jinx,Faster!
1,,,Hey! Hey!
1,Vi,Jinx,Look out!
1,,,Down there!
1,,,You can't get away!
1,,,Hey!
1,,,Come on!
1,,,Oh.
1,Vi,Jinx,This way!
1,,,Keep going!
1,,,"Go, go, go!"
1,,,"Oh, man, not again."
1,,,I just got this shirt...
1,,,Thought last time was the last time we were gonna do this.
1,Vi,Mylo,"Well, this time's the last time."
1,,,"Guys, what was that? What the hell happened back there?"
1,Jinx,Mylo,I don't know. I didn't do anything.
1,,,You could fill a damn library with all the things you didn't do.
1,Vi,Mylo,"Guys, we just emptied a Piltover penthouse right under the enforcers' noses."
1,Vi,Mylo,"So, if you're done beating yourselves up, let's get this home."
1,,,Nice haul?
1,,,You could say that.
1,,,I heard there was some action across the river.
1,,,"Someone, uh, someone really kicked the nest, huh?"
1,Vi,Deckerd,Is that so?
1,,,"But now you're, you're tracking this mess of yours through my streets."
1,Vi,Deckerd,Your streets? What makes you think...
1,,,"Listen, we don't want any trouble, okay?"
1,,,"Hear that, Deckard? They don't want any trouble."
1,,,"You know, in my experience, trouble finds you."
1,,,There's no reason this has to get ugly.
1,,,How about you share a little taste of your treasure there and we'll call it even?
1,,,"No, no, no. We worked too hard to..."
1,Vi,Deckerd,Just a taste?
1,,,Just a...
1,,,Huh?
1,,,Huh.
1,,,This day's turning out all right after all.
1,,,Wait!
1,Vi,Deckerd,Wanna see how that ends?
1,Vi,Claggor,Where's Powder?
1,,,Oh! Oh! You little...
1,,,Oh!
1,Jinx,Mouser,"Come on, Mouser, I need you!"
1,Jinx,,No.
1,Mylo,Jinx,You did what?
1,Jinx,Mylo,I'm sorry.
1,Jinx,Mylo,"I tried to fight him off with Mouser, but... she didn't work."
1,,,Who saw that coming?
1,,,We never should have gone over there.
1,Vi,Claggor,Doesn't matter. The stuff's gone.
1,Vi,Jinx,"It's all right, Powder. At least you're okay."
1,,,Okay? What about us?
1,,,"I get my face bashed in, and she just gets a pass?"
1,Vi,Mylo,Yup.
1,,,"Every time. Every time she comes, something goes wrong."
1,,,She jinxes every job.
1,Vi,Mylo,"Just drop it, Mylo."
1,,,Sit still!
1,,,"Come on, get out of here!"
1,,,You gotta pay!
1,,,Look at that!
1,,,Hey! Watch it.
1,,,Hey!
1,,,"Well, I, uh, suppose that concludes our business, then."
1,,,Mm. I suppose it does.
1,,,Wait...
1,,,"Uh, wait a minute."
1,,,"This, uh..."
1,,,"uh, this... isn't what we agreed on, so..."
1,,,"Well, demand for your wares has dropped since we made our arrangements."
1,,,This is the new value.
1,,,"Uh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait. We, um..."
1,,,we shook on it.
1,,,Ten thousand.
1,,,Such are the risks of business.
1,,,Ten.
1,,,It's a fair price.
1,,,I think you should take it.
1,,,"No, no, no, no. No, no, no, no, no."
1,,,I can't do that. I can't do that!
1,,,Make your choice.
1,,,You folks need anything?
1,,,Leave us.
1,,,You sure about that?
1,,,Sounded to me like...
1,,,Piss off.
1,,,Ah.
1,,,I think I know what you need.
1,,,"You don't seem to listen, barman..."
1,,,A bit of advice.
1,,,Don't threaten the guy who pours the drinks.
1,,,So you're Vander.
1,,,Hound of the Underground.
1,,,I expected something... younger.
1,,,"We were expecting traders who would honor their word,"
1,,,so I guess we're all disappointed.
1,,,"You got us all wrong, my friend."
1,,,We were just... negotiating.
1,,,Now you're speaking my language.
1,,,"How about you just give Huck the rest of what you owe him,"
1,,,and I'll let you walk out of here in one piece?
1,,,"Do we, uh... have a deal?"
1,,,This is vile.
1,,,You'll learn to love it.
1,,,Welcome to the Lanes.
1,Vi,Claggor,Vander learns none of this.
1,Mylo,Vi,No worries there. Powder took care of the evidence.
1,Jinx,Mylo,"I tried, okay? You don't get it. You're older, you're bigger."
1,Jinx,Mylo,"It, it isn't fair."
1,,,So stick with us!
1,,,Take a punch or two.
1,,,Everyone all right?
1,,,Never better.
1,,,Good.
1,,,I don't suppose you can explain why it is that I'm hearing about an explosion
1,,,and a foot chase topside?
1,,,Four children fleeing the scene.
1,,,What the hell were you thinking?
1,Vi,Vander,That we can handle a real job.
1,,,A real job?
1,Vi,Vander,"We got our own tip, planned a route, nobody even saw."
1,,,You blew up a building.
1,Vi,Vander,That wasn't...
1,,,Did you even stop to think about what could have happened to you?
1,,,Eh? To them?
1,,,Where did you even get this tip?
1,Jinx,Vander,We just heard it at Benzo's shop.
1,,,From?
1,Jinx,Vader,Little Man.
1,Vi,Vander,"I took us there. If you wanna be mad, be mad at me."
1,Vi,Vander,But you're the one who always says we have to earn our place in this world.
1,,,"I also told you time and time again, the Northside's off-limits."
1,,,We stay out of Piltover's business.
1,Vi,Vander,Why?
1,Vi,Vander,"They've got plenty, while we're down here scraping together coins."
1,Vi,Vander,When did you get so comfortable living in someone else's shadow?
1,,,Everyone out.
1,,,Sit down.
1,Vi,Vander,I'm fine.
1,,,Sit. Down.
1,,,Those kids look up to you.
1,Vi,Vander,"Yeah, I know."
1,,,"You know, but you don't know."
1,,,"When people look up to you, you don't get to be selfish."
1,Vi,Vander,I'm not...
1,,,"You say run, they run."
1,,,"You say swim, they dive in."
1,,,"You say light a fire, they show up with oil."
1,,,"But whatever happens, it's on you."
1,,,Just like it's on me what happens to us down here.
1,,,"We make ourselves a problem for Piltover, and they will send the enforcers."
1,Vi,Vander,So? Why answer to them?
1,Vi,Vander,These are our streets. Someone should remind them of that.
1,,,You're not hearing me. That path?
1,,,This?
1,,,It's not gonna solve your problems.
1,,,Just makes more of them.
1,,,We clear?
1,,,How'd you get this?
1,Vi,Vander,Some idiot was following us.
1,,,On our side? Who?
1,Vi,Vander,I don't know. He was after the stuff.
1,,,Where is it now?
1,Vi,Vander,We lost it.
1,,,All of it?
1,,,Good.
1,,,Nothing can tie you to what happened up there.
1,,,"You're gonna have to lay low for a bit, understand?"
1,Vi,Vander,Okay.
1,Vi,Vander,"We're gonna be fine, right?"
1,,,I'll take care of it.
1,,,"Oh, you did put that idiot on his ass, though, right?"
1,Vi,Vander,Mm.
1,,,"Get up, Claggor. We're going out."
1,,,"Wait, now?"
1,,,"Hey, hey, that's mine!"
1,,,"You wanna be treated like adults, right?"
1,,,Then you should know better than to come back from a job empty-handed.
1,,,I'm gonna have a little word with your informant.
1,,,"All right, give me the details of exactly what happened up there."
1,,,She's a problem.
1,Vi,Mylo,"Mylo, I'm really not..."
1,,,Do you remember what was in that bag?
1,,,The biggest payout we've ever seen and she just lost it.
1,Vi,Mylo,She made a mistake.
1,,,Name one time she hasn't.
1,Vi,Mylo,She's young.
1,,,Don't bullshit me.
1,,,You were twice the person at half her age.
1,Vi,Mylo,"You know what, Mylo? You're right."
1,Vi,Mylo,There's a bunch of things Powder just can't do.
1,,,You don't have to tell me twice.
1,Vi,Mylo,"Like, complain about everything."
1,,,What?
1,Vi,Mylo,And brag nonstop.
1,,,"Okay, okay, I see where this is going."
1,Vi,Mylo,Pick fights with the group when we need to focus.
1,,,"Vi, I..."
1,Vi,Mylo,And tell strangers on the street that we got a nice haul?
1,,,"I, I didn't mean to..."
1,Vi,Mylo,"Powder's my problem, okay?"
1,Vi,Mylo,Your problem is never knowing when to shut up.
1,Vi,Mylo,But I'm gonna help you with that. Ready?
1,Vi,Mylo,You see this look on my face?
1,Vi,Mylo,This will always mean it's time to shut up.
1,,,But... I...
1,,,Nobody comes in.
1,,,We're closed.
1,,,"Well, open up."
1,,,For good. You can take your worthless junk elsewhere.
1,,,Just as well.
1,,,Owner's the shittiest businessman I know.
1,,,Ekko. What's going on with that thing?
1,,,Give me a few seconds. The cannon pinion's still busted.
1,,,Finish it later. Vander and I need a word.
1,,,But...
1,,,Uh-uh. Off you go.
1,,,Claggor.
1,,,"He-he-hey, Little Man."
1,,,You're a little early.
1,,,My guys are still roundin' up this month's collections.
1,,,"Won't have numbers until next, um..."
1,,,Whoo.
1,,,Why are you muckin' about with this?
1,,,I assume you've heard.
1,,,"Yeah, me and half the undercity."
1,,,How could they be so stupid?
1,,,The younger folk think it's the right thing to do.
1,,,"Yeah, and Vi's one of them."
1,,,Throws herself at trouble wherever she can find some.
1,,,"Eh, they're growing up, Vander."
1,,,Looking to write their own stories. You can't protect them forever.
1,,,Someone was following them.
1,,,"Whole lot of someones, from what I heard."
1,,,Not enforcers.
1,,,Someone on our side.
1,,,Who?
1,,,There's worse things than enforcers out there.
1,,,We both know that.
1,,,"Yeah, I was hopin' you'd be working today."
1,,,Did you guys go?
1,,,Sure did.
1,,,"Hey, listen, how did you find that place?"
1,,,I just...
1,,,"Whoa, did you fight the enforcers?"
1,,,"What? Oh, no. Eh, just some bums."
1,,,"Oh, did Vi kick their asses?"
1,,,"Yeah, I mean, I wouldn't be here otherwise."
1,,,"Oh, she showed me a couple moves to practice. Look."
1,,,"Yeah, it's... it's coming along."
1,,,Ya!
1,,,"Hey, so, how'd you find that place, anyway?"
1,,,"Uh, this weirdo came into the shop."
1,,,Bought a whole bunch of stuff Benzo only keeps there for display.
1,,,He paid in gold and didn't even haggle.
1,,,I charged him double price. Sucker.
1,,,But how did you know where he lived?
1,,,"Uh, followed him."
1,,,How else?
1,,,Oh. Right.
1,,,"Oh, crap."
1,,,Uh...
1,,,They'll be fine. Go.
1,,,"Well, hello."
1,,,"Evening, friends."
1,,,Shit.
1,,,Something I can help you with?
1,,,"Some trencher trash attacked one of the buildings in the Academy district,"
1,,,but you already knew that.
1,,,We're looking for the culprits.
1,,,Got a description?
1,,,"Yeah, it's exactly who you're picturing in that thick head of yours."
1,,,Mm. You think my head is thick?
1,,,"Uh, just past the average."
1,,,"Listen, you shady son of a..."
1,,,"How about you go for a little walk, Marcus?"
1,,,Cool off a bit.
1,,,Go.
1,,,Lovely chap you've brought.
1,,,Don't mind the kid.
1,,,Doesn't know when to pipe down.
1,,,Some things are the same topside and bottom.
1,,,You know this crossed a line upstairs.
1,,,Was anyone hurt?
1,,,A building was blown to bits. What do you think?
1,,,Those who did this will be dealt with.
1,,,That workshop belonged to the Kirammans.
1,,,You know what kind of stuff they had in there?
1,,,Makes this place look like a candy shop.
1,,,The Council needs someone to make an example of.
1,,,People need to feel safe.
1,,,"Yeah, topside people."
1,,,"We had a deal, Vander."
1,,,"You keep your people off my streets, and I stay out of your business."
1,,,Give me a name. We'll do things quiet.
1,,,No one will know you were involved.
1,,,I can't do that.
1,,,You don't seem to grasp how serious this is.
1,,,"If I don't put someone behind bars tonight,"
1,,,"the next time I come down here, I'll have an army of enforcers with me."
1,,,We both know how that'll go.
1,,,"I'm sorry, Grayson, but I can't offer up my own people."
1,,,"If you change your mind, this will reach me."
1,,,And only me.
1,Vi,Jinx,What are you calling this one?
1,Jinx,Vi,Whisker.
1,Vi,Jinx,You wanna talk about today?
1,Jinx,Vi,What's the point?
1,Jinx,Vi,I ruined everything. I always do.
1,Vi,Jinx,Nobody said that.
1,Jinx,Vi,"No. Just that you were ""twice the person"" at half my age."
1,Jinx,Vi,You heard them.
1,Jinx,Vi,I'm not a fighter.
1,Vi,Jinx,You don't have to be.
1,Vi,Jinx,"Look, I've got these and you've got those."
1,Jinx,Vi,They never work.
1,Vi,Jinx,They will.
1,Vi,Jinx,Come with me.
1,Jinx,Vi,What?
1,Vi,Jinx,Come on.
1,Jinx,Vi,What are we doing here?
1,Vi,Jinx,See that gutter running along the canal?
1,Vi,Jinx,That's where Claggor got his foot stuck running from enforcers.
1,Vi,Jinx,"They thought it was funny, so they left him there."
1,Vi,Jinx,He was out all night before we found him.
1,Vi,Jinx,That sign?
1,Vi,Jinx,You see it?
1,Jinx,Vi,Uh-huh.
1,Vi,Jinx,Mylo tripped over his own paint bucket
1,Vi,Jinx,and nearly fell off trying to draw a giant middle finger.
1,Vi,Jinx,His ass made that splotch.
1,Vi,Jinx,And that?
1,Vi,Jinx,"When I was a kid, some guy took my favorite toy and threw it up there."
1,Vi,Jinx,"I used to come out here at night and stare at it,"
1,Vi,Jinx,hoping maybe the wind or a bird might knock it down.
1,Vi,Jinx,We've all had bad days.
1,Vi,Jinx,But we learn. And we stick together.
1,Jinx,Vi,"Oh, I forgot."
1,Jinx,Vi,These were in my pocket.
1,Jinx,Vi,They're from the apartment.
1,Vi,Jinx,What are they?
1,Jinx,Vi,I don't know.
1,Jinx,Vi,Should we show Vander?
1,Vi,Jinx,No.
1,Vi,Jinx,Let's keep this our little secret.
1,Vi,Jinx,"Mylo's wrong, Powder. You're stronger than you think."
1,Vi,Jinx,And one day...
1,Vi,Jinx,this city's gonna respect us.
1,Silco,Deckard,You were supposed to follow them and not interfere.
1,Deckard,Silco,I'm sorry.
1,Deckard,Silco,They just caught us by surprise.
1,Silco,Deckard,Now his accomplice is asking questions about you.
1,Silco,Deckard,That's not a risk I'm willing to take.
1,Deckard,Silco,"The kids. It was their fault, the explosion in the upper city."
1,Silco,Deckard,That was them?
1,Deckard,Silco,Yeah. The topsiders are up in arms looking for 'em.
1,Silco,Deckard,Vander's in trouble.
1,Silco,Deckard,"Smartest thing you ever said, boy."
1,Silco,,Get him a meal.
1,Silco,,But keep him off the streets.
1,Silco,Singed,Our timeline has moved up.
1,Singed,Silco,It's almost ready.
1,Silco,Deckard,Show me.
1,Singed,,Feeding time.
1,Silco,Deckard,And the side effects?
1,Singed,Silco,Stabilizing.
1,Singed,Silco,You have a subject in mind?
1,Silco,Deckard,Someone just volunteered.
,,,
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,You really went to the undercity to get these?
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,Weren't you afraid?
2,Jayce,Caitlyn,"A little danger is worth the risk, don't you think?"
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,Oh.
2,Jayce,Caitlyn,"Uh, careful."
2,Jayce,Caitlyn,That's your parents' money you're dropping.
2,Vi,Jinx,"Powder, we've gotta go!"
2,Jayce,,Hello? Is someone in there?
2,Jayce,,"Hey, open up!"
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,Jayce?
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,Jayce!
2,Jayce,Jayce's mom,Mom!
2,Jayce,Jayce's mom,"Mom. Mom, wake up."
2,Jayce,Jayce's mom,Mom.
2,Jayce,,"Help! Please, someone, help us!"
2,Jayce,,Help! Please!
2,Jayce,,No. Wait. Wait.
2,Jayce,,How?
2,Grayson,Jayce,Let's go over it again.
2,Jayce,Grayson,You have to believe me. I didn't do this.
2,Grayson,Jayce,"Relax, kid. We know it was a break-in but that doesn't explain this."
2,Grayson,Jayce,There's a lot of restricted items here and I don't see any permits.
2,Grayson,Jayce,You wanna tell me how you got them?
2,Jayce,,"Hey, hey! Be careful with that, please."
2,Viktor,,I believe someone should have said that earlier.
2,Viktor,,What happened here?
2,Jayce,,"Science, I guess?"
2,Grayson,Jayce,"Last time I checked, science didn't require illegal equipment."
2,Viktor,Jayce,Nor was this approved by the Academy. Who authorized your research?
2,Jayce,Viktor,It was an independent study. Who are you anyway?
2,Viktor,Jayce,"I'm assistant to the Dean of the Academy,"
2,Viktor,Jayce,who it may serve you to remember is also head of the Council.
2,Viktor,Jayce,He sent me here to ensure that anything dangerous is removed safely.
2,Viktor,Jayce,"Which, according to my list, includes you."
2,Jayce,Viktor,What? How am I dangerous?
2,Viktor,Jayce,"Uh, that's for the council to decide."
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Imprisonment. What a curious principle.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"We confine the physical body, yet the mind is still free."
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,I do love a good conundrum.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,I remember the first time I saw you at the Academy.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,You reminded me of myself.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,A scientist ready to forge a new vector of experimentation.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,But sometimes we venture too far.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,No great science should ever put lives in danger.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Be honest, now. What manner of inquiry was this?"
2,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"Professor Heimerdinger, I..."
2,Jayce,Heimerdinger,I believe I've discovered something truly incredible.
2,Jayce,Heimerdinger,A way to harness magic through science.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Magic?
2,Jayce,Heimerdinger,Yes.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,No.
2,Jayce,Heimerdinger,No?
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"The Arcane is dangerous, Jayce."
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,A force of nature. Science cannot control it.
2,Jayce,Heimerdinger,But maybe it can.
2,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"I'm close to a breakthrough, I know it."
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"How old are you, my boy?"
2,Jayce,Heimerdinger,I'm... I'm 24.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Ah.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Well, I am now 307 years old."
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"All my life, I've pursued the mysteries of science,"
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,only to discover some are better left unsolved.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"This, I'm afraid, is one of them."
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Own your mistakes before the Council, admit your work was dangerous,"
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,but speak nothing of magic.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Do that and I theorize you'll get away
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"with, um, how do you say, a slap on the wrist."
2,Mylo,Vi,Remind me why we bother with this dump.
2,Vi,Mylo,Vander said to lay low.
2,Vi,Mylo,"Enforcers never come down here, so this is as good a place as any."
2,Claggor,Mylo,"Oh, what's the matter, Mylo? You worried Powder's gonna beat you again?"
2,Mylo,Claggor,"Hey, if she didn't keep fixing these things,"
2,Mylo,Claggor,I wouldn't keep missing.
2,Mylo,Vi,"You guys know I wouldn't take you on a job you couldn't handle, right?"
2,Mylo,Vi,Are you kidding? That was the best job we've ever done.
2,Mylo,Vi,Maybe just don't take Powder next time.
2,Claggor,,Um...
2,Enforcer 1,,Get back.
2,Enforcer 2,,Tell me where I can find them.
2,,,Topsider business ain't my concern.
2,,,It's every one of you trencher's concern now.
2,,,Give me a name.
2,Jinx,,"Hey, guys? You should see this..."
2,,,Search them.
2,Mylo,,"Go ahead, idiots. We've got nothing."
2,,,Go!
2,,,Go!
2,Vi,Jinx,Come on!
2,,,Get them!
2,,,Over here!
2,Vi,Jinx,You need to hide those crystals.
2,Jinx,Vi,"Yeah, no shit."
2,Elora,Mel,The House Ferros received your letter.
2,Elora,Mel,They insist business is steady.
2,Mel,Elora,"Steady is stagnant, Elora."
2,Elora,Mel,They wished me to remind you that it's thanks to their innovations
2,Elora,Mel,that you are the richest person in Piltover.
2,Mel,Elora,Yet I remain the poorest Medarda.
2,,,"Excellent choice, Councilor Medarda. Supreme challenge."
2,,,If I may...
2,Mel,Elora,"We need something revolutionary, Elora."
2,Mel,Elora,Something to put Piltover on the map.
2,Mel,Elora,What of today's trial?
2,Elora,Mel,His name is Jayce of House Talis.
2,Mel,Elora,A House? Remind me.
2,Elora,Mel,They're toolmakers.
2,Elora,Mel,I believe they came to renown for their design of the...
2,Elora,Mel,collapsible pocket wrench.
2,Mel,Elora,But Heimerdinger favors him?
2,Elora,Mel,As far as I can tell.
2,Mel,Elora,Hmm.
2,Mel,servant,This one.
2,,,But that's...
2,,,"Well, that's a child's toy."
2,Mel,servant,Good.
2,,,The boy's got ambition.
2,,,It's why we supported him in the first place.
2,,,"Ambition? Darling, he nearly blew up our daughter."
2,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramann,Jayce had nothing to do with that. He was robbed.
2,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramann,We need to help him.
2,,,Caitlyn's right.
2,,,"We've known Jayce for years. Besides, we're his patrons."
2,,,"If anyone is meant to speak up for him, it's us."
2,,,We should hit them back. We've got the numbers to beat them.
2,,,Yeah. Let's teach them what it means to mess with us.
2,,,Yeah!
2,Vander,crowd,You sure that's what you want?
2,,,Let's do it.
2,Vander,crowd,"We crossed that bridge once before, and we all know how that ended."
2,,,You're just protecting your kids.
2,Vander,crowd,I'm protecting our people. I'd do the same for any one of you.
2,Vander,crowd,We look out for each other. It's the way it's always been.
2,Vander,crowd,This will blow over. We just need to stand together.
2,,,"The Vander I knew, the one who built the underground,"
2,,,wouldn't be afraid to fight.
2,Vander,,Do I look afraid?
2,,,No.
2,,,You look weak.
2,Claggor,,Why isn't he doing anything?
2,Jinx,,We kicked the Enforcers' butts with just the four of us.
2,Jinx,,Imagine what the whole of the Lanes could do.
2,Mylo,,"Jeez, even Powder wants to fight."
2,Vi,,"So, why aren't we?"
2,Vi,,"Spill it, Ekko."
2,Ekko,,Um...
2,Ekko,,"Oh, okay. Well, um, Vander's got a deal with the Enforcers."
2,Vi,,What deal?
2,Mel,Councilor 1,"For your birthday, Councilor."
2,,,"Ah, Mel, this is too kind."
2,Mel,Councilor 1,I'm told it was built only for the sharpest of minds.
2,,,And I bought you some Ginko nuts.
2,,,Don't you know I'm allergic?
2,,,What are you trying to do?
2,,,Kill an old man?
2,Mrs. Kiramann,,Jayce Talis.
2,Mrs. Kiramann,,You are accused of illegal experimentation and endangering the citizens of Piltover.
2,Mrs. Kiramann,,What do you have to say for yourself?
2,Jayce,,"The materials were far more dangerous than I was aware of,"
2,Jayce,,and I... I now know my actions were against Academy regulations.
2,Jayce,,"What I did endangered people. It was reckless, and for that, I'm sorry."
2,Jayce,,"I ask the Council's forgiveness, and I hope that I can continue my studies."
2,Mrs. Kiramann,,"As Jayce's patron of many years, I can speak for his character."
2,Mrs. Kiramann,,"I believe that one day,"
2,Mrs. Kiramann,,he will be a great contributor to our society.
2,,,He destroyed a building.
2,,,Is this the sort of contribution we can expect?
2,Heimerdinger,,"If you were a scientist,"
2,Heimerdinger,,you'd know you can't make a prototype without breaking a few wrenches.
2,Mel,,Do you have anything to show for your work besides an explosion?
2,Jayce,,"Uh, no. It came to nothing."
2,Mel,,"So, you're saying your study was meaningless?"
2,Jayce,,It was revolutionary!
2,Mel,,Revolutionary how?
2,Mel,,All I see is a boy meddling with things he doesn't understand.
2,,,The Academy seems to have loosened its standards.
2,,,"This is a fine line. If we condone this, what's next?"
2,,,"Ridiculous, really."
2,,,The Council has more important matters to deal with.
2,,,Perhaps we should just finish this...
2,Jayce,,I was trying to create magic.
2,,,Magic?
2,,,Arcane talents are something you're born with.
2,,,They can't be fabricated.
2,Jayce,,"Actually, I believe it is possible."
2,Mel,,Has anyone even tried it before?
2,,,The Arcane is the curse of our world. My race was nearly destroyed by it.
2,Jayce,,"Surely, we, the pioneers of science, can use it for good."
2,Jayce,,We're the champions of discovery. Why fear it when we can master it?
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Jayce, enough."
2,Jayce,,"This is the city of progress, think of the wonders we could create."
2,Jayce,,Let me prove...
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Enough!
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,You don't understand what's at stake.
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,But how can you?
2,Heimerdinger,Jayce,That's a burden that only I here carry.
2,Heimerdinger,,Time.
,Heimerdinger,,"I've seen this power in the wrong hands. It corrupts, consumes, lays waste to civilizations."
2,Heimerdinger,,"That cannot happen here, my boy. It must not."
2,,,Heimerdinger is right.
2,,,"Piltover was founded to escape the warmongering of mages,"
2,,,not cultivate it.
2,,,The Ethos is clear. He must be banished from Piltover.
2,,,"Please, let me speak!"
2,,,"As a lower house, my voice doesn't carry much weight here."
2,,,"But as a mother, I have a voice that matters deeply."
2,,,My son isn't in his right mind.
2,,,"His entire life, he's chased an impossible dream."
2,,,"What he did was, uh, foolish and unwise."
2,,,"But he has a good heart. Please, let him come home."
2,,,A crime like this can't be overlooked. The boy must be punished.
2,Heimerdinger,,"A violation of the Ethos calls for banishment,"
2,Heimerdinger,,but I can sympathize with a young man's dream to change the world.
2,Heimerdinger,,"Perhaps in this matter, a lesser sentence may suffice."
2,Heimerdinger,,I move that Jayce be summarily expelled from the Academy
2,Heimerdinger,,and remanded to the care of his parents.
2,Heimerdinger,,All those in favor?
2,Heimerdinger,Mrs. Talis,"You may take your son home, Mrs. Talis,"
2,Heimerdinger,Mrs. Talis,but he is to never set foot on Academy grounds again.
2,Marcus,Silco,First time I've been invited to the Lanes. It better be worth my time.
2,Silco,Marcus,"Ah, you see, that's your weakness, Marcus."
2,Silco,Marcus,"You carry your chin so high, you fail to see the opportunity below."
2,Marcus,Silco,Who are you?
2,Silco,Marcus,"You're looking for four children,"
2,Silco,Marcus,the ones running circles around Piltover's finest.
2,Marcus,Silco,What about it?
2,Silco,Marcus,Don't look so concerned. I'm about to make your day.
2,,,Can I come in?
2,Jayce,Mrs. Talis,Hmm.
2,,,I still remember the look on your face when you found these.
2,,,"Jayce, please. If I hadn't spoken, you'd be lost to me."
2,,,I had to say something.
2,Jayce,Mrs. Talis,Magic saved your life.
2,,,"Yes, but it won't save yours now. You need to let it go."
2,Jayce,Mrs. Talis,I could've convinced the Council.
2,Jayce,Mrs. Talis,"If my own family won't help me, I'll find someone who will."
2,Heimerdinger,Viktor,Oh. That foolish boy.
2,Viktor,Heimerdinger,"Yeah, I must admit, his theory intrigues."
2,Heimerdinger,Viktor,"If dangerous ideas didn't excite the imagination,"
2,Heimerdinger,Viktor,we would never wander astray.
2,Viktor,Heimerdinger,Could it work? Could these stones really invoke magic?
2,Heimerdinger,Viktor,Nonsense. It's far too unstable.
2,Viktor,Heimerdinger,Could you stabilize it?
2,Heimerdinger,Viktor,Me? Why would I?
2,Heimerdinger,Viktor,"That only leads to more problems,"
2,Heimerdinger,Viktor,and that poor boy has enough of them already.
2,Heimerdinger,Viktor,"There. Come tomorrow morning, his research will be safely disposed of."
2,Heimerdinger,Viktor,Lock up.
2,Heimerdinger,,"No, no, no. Magic is far too dangerous in the wrong hands."
2,Silco,Singed,Will he live?
2,Singed,Silco,Long enough.
2,Silco,Deckard,"Beautiful, aren't they?"
2,Silco,Deckard,"Yet, up there on the surface,"
2,Silco,Deckard,no one even knows they exist.
2,Deckard,Silco,They're monsters.
2,Silco,Deckard,There's a monster inside all of us.
2,Deckard,Silco,"What? No. No, no! It'll kill me!"
2,Silco,Deckard,I'd like to let you in on a very important secret
2,Silco,Deckard,"I learned when I was about your age, boy."
2,Silco,Deckard,"You see, power,"
2,Silco,Deckard,"real power doesn't come to those who were born strongest,"
2,Silco,Deckard,"or fastest, or smartest."
2,Silco,Deckard,No.
2,Silco,Deckard,It comes to those who will do anything to achieve it.
2,Silco,Deckard,It's time to let the monster out.
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,They won't see you.
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,Your name's no good now.
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,"My dad says you're a misfit, and that we can't be friends anymore."
2,Jayce,Caitlyn,"So, why are you out here?"
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,"I'm a misfit too, I suppose."
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,What will you do?
2,Jayce,Caitlyn,"Join the Talis hammer business, I guess."
2,Caitlyn,Jayce,You can't do that.
2,Jayce,Caitlyn,"No, I can't."
2,Mrs. Kiramann,Caitlyn,"Come inside, Caitlyn. Now."
2,Jayce,Mrs. Kiramann,I'm sorry. I just wanted to explain...
2,Mrs. Kiramann,Jayce,I think you've done enough.
2,Mel,Grayson,You said this was a break in.
2,Mel,Grayson,Did they take anything dangerous?
2,Grayson,Mel,Hard to say.
2,Grayson,Mel,"We don't exactly know what we did find, let alone what we didn't."
2,,,This mention of magic has the people afraid.
2,,,The culprits must be apprehended.
2,Grayson,Councilor,"We're doing our best, Councilor. I assure you."
2,,,Your attitude makes me question if your best is up to the task.
2,,,"Oh, we'll find them. Don't worry."
2,Grayson,Councilor,"We've conducted exhaustive interrogations, frozen commerce for half the district."
2,Grayson,Councilor,"With all due respect, Councilor,"
2,Grayson,Councilor,don't you think we've pushed them hard enough?
2,,,Do whatever it takes.
2,,,Turn the undercity upside down if you have to.
2,,,Just find them!
2,Vander,Marcus,Welcome to The Last Drop.
2,Vander,Marcus,What can I get you?
2,Marcus,Vander,Four sump-rats will do.
2,Marcus,,Search the place.
2,Vander,Marcus,"While you're wasting your time, how about a proper drink?"
2,Marcus,Vander,I'll take the strongest shit you got.
2,Vander,Marcus,Mm. You be careful with that.
2,Marcus,Vander,Nearly forgot. I ran into an old friend of yours.
2,Marcus,Vander,He had some stories.
2,Marcus,Vander,"You weren't always the peacekeeper, were you?"
2,Vander,Marcus,"Yeah, well, you can't escape the past. Right?"
2,Vander,Marcus,Be a shame if I had to put them on again.
2,Vander,Marcus,"Cast iron's, well, it's hard to clean."
2,Marcus,Vander,"You people down here are all the same,"
2,Marcus,Vander,mistaking arrogance for bravery.
2,Marcus,Vander,"You think you're standing up for something,"
2,Marcus,Vander,but we all know there is a crime
2,Marcus,Vander,behind every coin that passes through this place.
2,Marcus,Vander,You're just a small man in a little hole the world forgot to bury.
2,Marcus,Vander,And I'm gonna bury the lot of you.
2,Vander,,Are you all okay?
2,Vi,Vander,"No, we're not okay. They almost saw Powder."
2,Vi,Vander,What if they took her?
2,Vander,Vi,No one is taking any of you.
2,Vander,Vi,Never let that happen.
2,Vi,Vander,It's already happening.
2,Vi,Vander,"You heard him, they won't stop. We need to fight back."
2,Vi,Vander,"And if you won't, I will."
2,Vander,Vi,I've heard this kind of talk before.
2,Vi,Vander,Why are we here?
2,Vander,Vi,You still don't understand.
2,Vi,Vander,What I don't understand is how you can work with them.
2,Vi,Vander,We were here. We saw what they did.
2,Vi,Vander,"I grew up knowing I'm less than them, that my place is down there."
2,Vi,Vander,"I want Powder to have more than that, and I'm willing to fight for it."
2,Vander,Vi,"So was I. I was angry, just like you."
2,Vander,Vi,"I led us across this bridge, thinking things could change."
2,Vander,Vi,If I hadn't...
2,Vander,Vi,your parents would still be alive.
2,Vander,Vi,I know you wanna hurt the topsiders for what they've done to us.
2,Vander,Vi,But who are you willing to lose?
2,Vander,Vi,Mylo? Claggor?
2,Vander,Vi,Powder?
2,Vander,Vi,"Nobody wins in war, Vi."
2,Vi,Vander,What are we gonna do?
2,Vander,Vi,The Enforcers will come back.
2,Vander,Vi,"I... I don't know. I'll, uh, I'll figure it out."
2,Viktor,Jayce,Am I interrupting?
2,Jayce,Viktor,The hell's your problem? What's that? Another list with my name on it?
2,Viktor,Jayce,"Actually, yes, but only because you signed your notes."
2,Viktor,Jayce,"Every page, I might add. Eh, a little egotistical, don't you think?"
2,Jayce,Viktor,Is that why you came? To insult me?
2,Viktor,Jayce,"No, no, I was... I was intrigued by what you said at the trial."
2,Jayce,Viktor,That makes you the only one.
2,Viktor,Jayce,"Yes, well, I wanted to talk about your work."
2,Viktor,Jayce,This Hextech theory of yours.
2,Jayce,Viktor,It's not a theory.
2,Jayce,Viktor,"I saw with my own eyes what magic can do, the lives it could save."
2,Jayce,Viktor,You've no idea how beautiful it is.
2,Jayce,Viktor,And now it's gone. No one believed me.
2,Viktor,Jayce,Nobody's ever believed in me.
2,Viktor,Jayce,A poor cripple from the undercity.
2,Viktor,Jayce,I was an outsider the moment I stepped foot in Piltover.
2,Viktor,Jayce,I didn't have the benefits of a patron or a name.
2,Viktor,Jayce,I simply believed in myself.
2,Viktor,Jayce,Which is why I'm here because I think you're on to something.
2,Viktor,Jayce,I want to help you complete your research.
2,Jayce,Viktor,No one thinks it can be done.
2,Viktor,Jayce,"When you're going to change the world, don't ask for permission."
2,Jayce,Viktor,I don't even know your name.
2,Viktor,Jayce,It's Viktor.
2,Mylo,Vi,"Vi, where you been?"
2,Claggor,Vi,Rumor is the Lanes are gonna fight.
2,Jinx,Vi,"Look, I made them for the Enforcers."
2,Jinx,Vi,"These are smoke bombs, and those two are full of nails."
2,Jinx,Vi,"They're gonna work this time, I know it."
2,Vi,Jinx,Me too.
2,Vi,Jinx,"You know, Powder, what makes you different makes you strong."
2,Vi,Jinx,"Always remember that, okay?"
2,Grayson,Marcus,"What the hell were you thinking, going into The Last Drop?"
2,Grayson,Marcus,Do you have any idea what you've done?
2,Marcus,Grayson,I was getting results!
2,Grayson,Marcus,You heard the Council.
2,Grayson,Marcus,You're a fool.
2,Grayson,Marcus,There is no stopping what happens now.
2,Grayson,Marcus,Maybe it's not too late.
,,,
3,Silco,,Ever wonder what it's like to drown? Story of opposites.
3,Silco,,"There's peace in water. Like it's holdin' you, whisperin' in low tones to let it in."
3,Silco,,"And every problem in the world will fade away. But then, there is this thing in your head, and it's raging."
3,Silco,,"Lighting every nerve with madness. To fight. To survive. And all the while, this question lingers before you:"
3,Silco,,"""Have you had enough?"" It's funny. You could pass a lifetime without ever facing a choice like that."
3,Silco,,"But it changes you forever. For that, I thank you, old friend."
3,Vi,Vander,Vander?
3,Vander,Vi,We don't have much time.
3,Vi,Vander,How did you find me?
3,Vander,Vi,I'm proud of you. Always have been.
3,Vi,Vander,"I'm sorry, I... This is the only way to protect the others."
3,Vander,Vi,Vander.
3,Vander,Vi,You've got a good heart. Don't ever lose it.
3,Vander,Vi,No matter how the world tries to break you.
3,Vander,Vi,Protect the family.
3,Vi,Vander,What are you...
3,Vi,Vander,No.
3,Vi,Vander,Vander.
3,Vi,Vander,Let me out. This isn't right.
3,Grayson,Vander,I'm guessing that's for me.
3,Marcus,Vander,You gonna let us make the arrest or not?
3,Vander,Marcus,You'll oblige a doomed man one last smoke.
3,Vander,Marcus,Won't you?
3,Grayson,Vander,"I'm not putting you away, Vander."
3,Vander,Grayson,The Council needs its pound of flesh.
3,Grayson,Vander,"Without you down here, it all falls apart."
3,Vander,Grayson,Benzo will handle things.
3,Vander,Grayson,"I may not have my devilish charm, but he runs a tight ship."
3,Vi,Vander,"Vander, no. You can't do this."
3,Grayson,Vander,You won't be coming back for a long time.
3,Vander,Grayson,I know.
3,Grayson,Vander,Why?
3,Vander,Grayson,Mm.
3,Vander,Grayson,It's the only way.
3,Vi,Benzo,"Benzo, open the damn door."
3,Vi,,What's happening?
3,Grayson,,Hey. Stop right there!
3,Benzo,,What the devil...
3,Benzo,,No.
3,Benzo,Silco,Silco?
3,Benzo,Silco,You animal. Go crawl back into whatever hole you came out of.
3,Vander,Benzo,"Benzo, stay back."
3,Silco,Benzo,You never did know when to walk away.
3,Vander,Benzo,Wait.
3,Vander,Benzo,No!
3,Silco,Benzo,Hmm. Stubborn to the end.
3,Marcus,Silco,What the hell have you done? This wasn't the deal!
3,Silco,Marcus,Deal's changed.
3,Vi,,No.
3,Vi,,No!
3,Jayce,Viktor,"This entire time, I thought I needed to dampen the oscillations."
3,Viktor,Jayce,The crystals will only stabilize at high frequency.
3,Viktor,Jayce,You have to...
3,Jayce,Viktor,Crank it.
3,Viktor,Jayce,Yes. Yes. You have to... crank it.
3,Jayce,Viktor,It works.
3,Viktor,Jayce,Eh... On paper.
3,Jayce,Viktor,"Well, we could test it if we had access to my equipment."
3,Viktor,Jayce,Which is being destroyed tomorrow.
3,Jayce,Viktor,What?
3,Viktor,Jayce,"Oh. I... Yeah. I, I meant to tell you."
3,Jayce,Viktor,That research is everything. My... my whole life.
3,Jayce,Viktor,"Maybe if we showed them the equations,"
3,Jayce,Viktor,they'd let us...
3,Viktor,Jayce,We need more than promises.
3,Viktor,Jayce,We need proof.
3,Jayce,Viktor,Not without the crystals. The enforcers took them all. They're gone.
3,Viktor,Jayce,Yeah. Locked away in Heimerdinger's lab.
3,Jayce,Viktor,No. No. No. You heard the Council. If we're wrong...
3,Viktor,Jayce,Better be right then.
3,Jayce,Viktor,Why? Why would you risk this?
3,Viktor,Jayce,Do you think it was my life's ambition to be an assistant?
3,Viktor,Jayce,Scientists seek discoveries.
3,Viktor,Jayce,Ways to make the world a better place.
3,Viktor,Jayce,This Hextech dream of yours has the potential to do that.
3,Jayce,Viktor,Our Hextech dream.
3,Ekko,Vi,I saw everything.
3,Ekko,Vi,Be... Benzo. They...
3,Vi,Ekko,What about Vander?
3,Ekko,Vi,They took him.
3,Vi,Ekko,Where?
3,Silco,Vander,"It's a little crude, I'll admit."
3,Silco,Vander,The base violence necessary for change.
3,Silco,Vander,But we both know topside won't listen to anything else.
3,Vander,Silco,"Even with your monsters, you won't win a war against Piltover."
3,Silco,Vander,I don't have to. I just need to scare them.
3,Silco,Vander,They won't dare set foot in the underground again.
3,Vander,Silco,You'll get people killed. For what? Pride?
3,Silco,Vander,For respect.
3,Silco,Vander,Opportunity. Everything they've denied us.
3,Vander,Silco,You had my respect.
3,Vander,Silco,"The Lanes' respect, but that... that was never enough for you."
3,Silco,Vander,"We shared a vision, Vander. A dream of freedom."
3,Silco,Vander,"Not just for the Lanes, but the whole of the underground, united as one."
3,Silco,Vander,The nation of Zaun.
3,Silco,Vander,Do you even remember?
3,Silco,Vander,I trusted you.
3,Silco,Vander,And you betrayed me.
3,Vander,Silco,What I did to you...
3,Vander,Silco,I've never forgiven myself. You were my brother.
3,Silco,Vander,"No, you still don't understand."
3,Silco,Vander,Can you imagine what it's like?
3,Silco,Vander,When your blood mixes with the filth and the river toxins eat through your nerves.
3,Silco,Vander,"Oh, I hated you for what you'd done. But as time passed, so did my hate."
3,Silco,Vander,And I was left with an understanding.
3,Silco,Vander,The only way to defeat a superior enemy is to stop at nothing.
3,Silco,Vander,To become what they fear.
3,Silco,Vander,"I hated you, but you kept my respect."
3,Silco,Vander,Until you made peace with them.
3,Silco,Vander,Played lapdog after everything we suffered.
3,Vander,Silco,I had no choice.
3,Silco,Vander,Perhaps.
3,Silco,Vander,But now you do.
3,Silco,Vander,Shimmer. We have the power.
3,Silco,Vander,"We can finally realize our dream,"
3,Silco,Vander,brother.
3,Vander,Silco,Look at what you've done.
3,Vander,Silco,Benzo. These kids.
3,Vander,Silco,"In fighting topside, you'd sacrifice everything that we are."
3,Vander,Silco,It's not the way. Can't you see that?
3,Vander,Silco,"Kill me if you have to, but please spare the Lanes."
3,Silco,Vander,"You'd die for the cause, but you won't fight for one?"
3,Vander,Silco,I'm just... not that man anymore.
3,Silco,Vander,I'll show you what you really are.
3,Viktor,Jayce,Hmm.
3,Viktor,Jayce,"So far, so good."
3,Mel,Jayce,Hmm. Willing to risk exile for your endeavor.
3,Mel,Jayce,That's quite the conviction.
3,Jayce,Mel,Councilor.
3,Jayce,Mel,"What a surprise to see you, huh?"
3,Viktor,Mel,"Wait a minute, this isn't my bedroom."
3,Viktor,Mel,How could I have...
3,Jayce,Mel,Please. We can prove that it works.
3,Mel,Jayce,"Hmm. You couldn't do so earlier today, how is tonight any different?"
3,Viktor,Mel,We figured out how to stabilize it.
3,Mel,Viktor,You're the Professor's assistant.
3,Jayce,Mel,"No, he's my new partner."
3,Mel,Jayce,"Even if you manage to prove your theory, the Council would destroy it."
3,Viktor,Mel,Heimerdinger will recognize the potential.
3,Mel,Viktor,He already does.
3,Mel,Viktor,It scares him. It scares them all.
3,Jayce,Mel,What about you?
3,Mel,Jayce,I recognize that any worthwhile venture involves risk.
3,Jayce,Mel,"Councilor, this technology, it's real."
3,Jayce,Mel,"And no matter what happens here, it's going to change our world."
3,Jayce,Mel,We should be the ones to lead it.
3,Jayce,Mel,"Piltover, the land of progress, equality, innovation."
3,Jayce,Mel,"I know it sounds impossible, but when have we ever let that stop us?"
3,Jayce,Mel,"Please, just give us a chance."
3,Mel,Jayce and Viktor,"One night, gentlemen. Impress me, or I'd suggest you pack your bags."
3,Mel,Harold,Harold.
3,Harold,Mel,Oh. Oh.
3,Harold,Mel,"Oh, Councilor Medarda, you... you nearly scared me to death."
3,Mel,Harold,Ah. Another late night. The work just doesn't end.
3,Harold,Mel,"Well, I suppose that's a sign of good business, huh?"
3,Mylo,Claggor,"Well, if the enforcers hit tonight, we'll be ready..."
3,Mylo,Claggor,I think.
3,Claggor,Mylo,Dibs on the bat.
3,Mylo,Claggor,"No, no, no, no. I found it."
3,Claggor,Mylo,But I called it.
3,Mylo,Claggor,But I found it.
3,Claggor,Mylo,Respect the dibs.
3,Mylo,Claggor,I called it already.
3,Claggor,Mylo,Respect the...
3,Mylo,Claggor,Stop being such a big baby.
3,Claggor,Vi,Vi?
3,Vi,,Where's the...
3,Jinx,Vi,"Oh, you're back."
3,Mylo,Vi,Hey. Those are Vander's. Slow down. What's going on?
3,Vi,,Benzo's dead.
3,Mylo,Vi,Dead?
3,Vi,,They took Vander.
3,Mylo,,Who took Vander?
3,Vi,,I don't know. But I need to help him.
3,Mylo,,We're going with you.
3,Vi,,Whatever killed Benzo... was like nothing I've ever seen.
3,Vi,,It tore him apart.
3,Claggor,Vi,"You're not doing this alone, Vi."
3,Claggor,Vi,He's our father too.
3,Mylo,,Do we know where they took him?
3,Vi,,Ekko followed them.
3,Vi,,The old cannery next to the docks. He said...
3,Vi,Jinx,"I need you to sit this one out, Powder."
3,Jinx,Vi,What?
3,Vi,Jinx,You're not coming.
3,Jinx,Vi,I'm not afraid.
3,Vi,Jinx,It's too dangerous.
3,Jinx,Vi,But families stick together. You said it yourself.
3,Vi,Jinx,I know what I said...
3,Jinx,Vi,I want to fight. I can help.
3,Vi,Jinx,You're not ready.
3,Vi,Jinx,You're all I have left.
3,Vi,Jinx,I can't lose you.
3,Vi,Jinx,"Here. If they come for you, take this and run."
3,Vi,Jinx,"Where ever you are, light it up, and I'll find you. I promise."
3,Jayce,Viktor,It's all here.
3,Viktor,Jayce,It's time to crank it.
3,Jayce,Viktor,Are you sure you know what you're doing?
3,Jayce,Viktor,I don't think it's gonna hold! Look at the buildup!
3,Viktor,Jayce,The resonance will stabilize it.
3,Viktor,Jayce,Trust me.
3,Enforcer,,"Hey, you seeing this?"
3,Jinx,,I can help them.
3,Vi,,Let's get Vander and get out.
3,Viktor,Jayce,I told you it would work.
3,Viktor,Jayce,All yours.
3,Jayce,Viktor,Wow.
3,Jayce,Viktor,It's never done that before.
3,Jayce,Viktor,All right. Here we go.
3,Viktor,Jayce,Disengage!
3,Viktor,Jayce,Incredible.
3,Vander,Vi,Vi.
3,Vander,Vi,What are you doing here?
3,Vi,Vander,We're breakin' you out.
3,Vi,Mylo,Mylo.
3,Mylo,Vi,On it.
3,Vander,Vi,How... how did you get in?
3,Vander,Vi,There's guards everywhere.
3,Vi,Vander,It was easy. We found an open window and...
3,Vander,Vi,"Oh, god."
3,Vander,Vi,You have to get out. Now.
3,Silco,,Welcome.
3,Silco,,You have my congratulations.
3,Silco,Vi,But I'm afraid this will be a very short reunion.
3,Silco,Vi,Have you heard the rumor?
3,Silco,Vi,Vander the coward fled town with his children.
3,Silco,Vi,And they were never seen again.
3,Vi,Claggor,"Claggor, see if you can find another way out of here."
3,Claggor,Vi,Okay.
3,Vander,Vi,You don't have to do this.
3,Vi,Vander,"Yes, I do."
3,Vander,Vi,Vi.
3,Vander,Mylo,Mylo.
3,Vander,Mylo,Take a breath. You can do this.
3,Claggor,Vander,We're gonna get you out.
3,Silco,Deckard,Ready to rise to the surface?
3,Vander,Mylo,"Mylo, hurry."
3,Jinx,Vi,Vi!
3,Vander,Silco,Silco. Let her go.
3,Vander,Silco,This is between you and me.
3,Silco,Vander,You had your chance.
3,Vander,Vi,Vi.
3,Vander,Vi,You did good.
3,Enforcers,,Open up.
3,Heimredinger,,Stop this lunacy at once.
3,Viktor,Jayce,They're almost through. No pressure.
3,Enforcers,,Open the door.
3,Jayce,Viktor,That sounds like pressure!
3,Enforcers,,Open it.
3,Heimerdinger,,Excuse me. Underfoot.
3,Heimerdinger,,You've actually done it.
3,Heimerdinger,,"But just because it can be done, doesn't mean..."
3,Heimerdinger,,Will you please stop hovering?
3,Viktor,Heimerdinger,"I'm not sure how to do that, sir."
3,Heimerdinger,,"This is not what Piltover's future looks like, my dear boys."
3,Mel,Heimerdinger,That's for the Council to decide.
3,Mel,Heimerdinger,Perhaps it's time.
3,Mel,Heimerdinger,For the era of magic.
3,Jayce,Mel,"Uh, Hextech. For the era of Hextech."
3,Jinx,,You have to work. For me. Okay?
3,Silco,Deckard,Kill them.
3,Silco,Vander,I knew you still had it in you.
3,Silco,Deckard,Find the girl.
3,Vander,Silco,Silco!
3,Vi,Vander,Vander.
3,Vi,Vander,Vander...
3,Vander,Vi,Take care of Powder.
3,Vi,,No!
3,Jinx,Vi,"Vi, it worked."
3,Vi,Jinx,What?
3,Jinx,Vi,Did you see me?
3,Jinx,Vi,My monkey bomb finally worked.
3,Vi,Jinx,You did this?
3,Vi,Jinx,Why?
3,Vi,Jinx,Why did you do this?
3,Jinx,Vi,I... I didn't...
3,Jinx,Vi,I was saving you.
3,Jinx,Vi,I only wanted to help.
3,Jinx,Vi,I only wanted to help. I only wanted to help.
3,Jinx,Vi,I only wanted to...
3,Vi,Jinx,I told you to stay away.
3,Jinx,Vi,Please. Please. Please...
3,Vi,Jinx,I told you to stay away!
3,Jinx,Vi,No. Why did you leave me?
3,Vi,Jinx,Because you're a jinx. Do you hear me? Mylo was right.
3,Jinx,Vi,"No. No. No. No. Violet, please."
3,Jinx,Vi,"Violet, please."
3,Jinx,Vi,"Vi! Vi, come back! Please come back!"
3,Jinx,Vi,"Please, Violet. I need you. Please."
3,Jinx,Vi,Violet...
3,Jinx,Vi,Violet. Please.
3,Vi,Jinx,Powder.
3,Vi,Jinx,Pow...
3,Marcus,Vi,Shh.
3,Marcus,Vi,He'll kill you if he hears you.
3,Marcus,Vi,Come on. Let's go.
3,Silco,Jinx,"Hello, little girl."
3,Silco,Jinx,Where's your sister?
3,Jinx,Silco,She left me.
3,Jinx,Silco,She is not my sister anymore.
3,Silco,Jinx,It's okay.
3,Silco,Jinx,We'll show them.
3,Silco,Jinx,We will show them all.
,,,
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"You wanted to see me, Professor?"
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Ah. Come in, Jayce."
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Can you believe it?
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Our city is about to turn 200 years old.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,A bicentennial.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,It's shaping up to be an amazing Progress Day.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"Stanwick Padidly? Huh, I don't know much about him."
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Everything he built either exploded, melted, or toppled over."
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"And yet, here he stands."
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Stanwick set his personal ambitions aside
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,and focused on something far more important.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Our future.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,He realized nothing he could accomplish
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,could compare to the contributions of his students.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,I had no idea.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,That was his sacrifice.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,A dear friend.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,The Council has recommended you give the Progress Day speech this year.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,What... But you always give that speech.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,I... I could never take your place.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,I agree with them.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Your Hexgates have done wonders for our city.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Brought scholars from distant lands. Reignited passions in arts and science.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,You deserve this honor.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"I... I will do my best to make Piltover proud, Professor."
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"It's short notice, I know,"
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,but perhaps there's something in the lab you might be able to share?
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,People love a grand reveal.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,Viktor and I have just the thing. The next chapter of Hextech.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"Come to the lab this afternoon, I'll show you."
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,I'll look forward to it.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"You certainly have something to live up to, my boy."
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,"Our most famous protégé, Jayce Talis."
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,"The visionary behind the Hexgates,"
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,a beacon of trade and prosperity for our great City of Progress.
4,Jayce,,Excuse me.
4,Jayce,,"Sorry, sorry. Yeah. Excuse me."
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,He's a very busy man.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,Cait.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,Serves you right.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,You still avoiding her?
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,I'm working.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,"Oh, I can see that."
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,"I mean, there's so much crime to thwart outside your family's tent."
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,I can only imagine the strings she pulled to have me posted here.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,"It's your fault really,"
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,"for not following her into a career ""more befitting your station."""
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,She'd do anything to keep me from seeing the real world.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,"Well, at least you'll have front-row seats to the speech."
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,Speech?
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,Mm-hmm. I'm giving the big address tonight.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,Hmm. We really have descended to anarchy.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,Have fun herding the drunkards.
4,,,Happy Progress Day.
4,,,"Uh, shipping manifest?"
4,,,From your friend. Downtown.
4,,,Let's go!
4,,,"Ah, shit. The Firelights."
4,,,We have five minutes till they're out of there.
4,,,You ever seen this much Shimmer before?
4,,,They're expanding. Check for more below. Burn it all.
4,,,"Oh, no, no, no, no, no. Open up."
4,,,Open the door.
4,,,"Oh, no. She's here."
4,,,What the...
4,Jinx,,Hi.
4,Jinx,,Vi?
4,Vi,Jinx,I can't lose you.
4,Jinx,Vi,Why did you leave me?
4,Vi,Jinx,Because you're a jinx.
4,,,No.
4,Sevika,Jinx,You were supposed to guard the cargo.
4,Viktor,Jayce,You think he will approve?
4,Jayce,Viktor,Heimerdinger believes science should be used
4,Jayce,Viktor,to improve lives as much as we do.
4,Jayce,Viktor,We just need to show him it's safe.
4,Viktor,Jayce,And what about the Council?
4,Jayce,Viktor,We stabilized the crystal like they asked.
4,Jayce,Viktor,Built the Hexgates like they asked.
4,Jayce,Viktor,It's our turn to decide the future of Hextech.
4,Jayce,Viktor,Professor. I'm so glad you could make it.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Wouldn't miss it for the world, my boy. What do we have on the docket?"
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,It all began with this.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"A crystal of magical energy,"
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,too volatile to be handled outside our workshops.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,Hextech was supposed to bring magic into the life of the common man.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"And now, it finally can."
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,A Hextech Gemstone.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Wait.
4,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Holy sprockets.
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,We've found a means to fortify the crystals.
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,This new version is stable and absolutely safe.
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,We present to you the next chapter of Hextech.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,We can now design portable devices.
4,Heimerdinger,,Oh...
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,The Gemstone can power virtually anything.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,The Atlas Gauntlets.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,The mining colonies in the fissures can work faster and without fatigue.
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,The Hex Claw.
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,"A mechanical arm, equipped with a powerful ray of light."
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,Imagine what our artificers could do with such a device.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,I want Hextech to be a tool for us to build a new world.
4,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"And now, it's finally possible."
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,"Anyway, this is our presentation."
4,Heimerdinger,,"Quite amazing, gentlemen. You should be very proud."
4,Heimerdinger,,"Obviously, there are a few kinks to iron out and screws to be tightened,"
4,Heimerdinger,,"but give it a decade of careful research, and it will be ready."
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,A decade?
4,Heimerdinger,Viktor,"Oh, don't worry, my boy. It zips past you in the blink of an eye."
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,"With respect, Professor."
4,Viktor,Heimerdinger,We can be improving lives with Hextech now.
4,Heimerdinger,Viktor,"A breakthrough like this takes time, Viktor."
4,Heimerdinger,Viktor,Putting that kind of power into everyone's hands is dangerous.
4,Heimerdinger,Viktor,Keep at it and I'm sure you will discover a way
4,Heimerdinger,Viktor,to safeguard Hextech against misuse.
4,,,"There must've been four, five of them. I don't know how they got inside."
4,Caitlyn,Grunt,You're from the undercity.
4,Grunt,Caitlyn,I didn't do anything. She's crazy.
4,Caitlyn,Grunt,Easy.
4,Grunt,Caitlyn,She shot me.
4,Caitlyn,Grunt,Who shot you? Who were you working for?
4,Grunt,Caitlyn,I can't. He'll kill me.
4,Caitlyn,Grunt,Who?
4,Caitlyn,Grunt,I can protect you.
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,"Caitlyn Kiramman, why does that not surprise me?"
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,"Interfering in an investigation, again."
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,You're supposed to be guarding your mother's tent.
4,Caitlyn,Marcus,"I was, Sheriff, but she doesn't need it. And clearly, this takes priority."
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,"I realize you're used to getting your way, Kiramman,"
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,but we have a chain of command for a reason.
4,Caitlyn,Marcus,I understand.
4,Caitlyn,Marcus,But there's more going on here than just the smuggling.
4,Caitlyn,Marcus,If I could just question him I could...
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,I'll take it from here.
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,"Since you're looking for more work,"
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,you can take the graveyard shift tonight at the fair.
4,Caitlyn,Marcus,"Yes, sir."
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,Good.
4,Marcus,Caitlyn,I want this one on a boat to Stillwater prison.
4,Enforcer,Marcus,"Yes, sir."
4,Sevika,Silco,She fired on us.
4,Silco,Sevika,There are always mishaps in battle.
4,Silco,Sevika,The Firelights were her target and most are dead.
4,Sevika,Silco,"It wasn't a mishap, she froze up and lost her shit."
4,Sevika,Silco,I could've handled those brats.
4,Sevika,Silco,She's a problem and we all know it.
4,Silco,Sevika,We?
4,Silco,Sevika,Who's we?
4,Silco,Sevika,I expect better from you than excuses.
4,Silco,Sevika,It was your job to make sure things went smoothly.
4,Silco,Sevika,You failed. Don't disappoint me again.
4,Silco,Jinx,"The world's growing smaller every day, thanks to the Hexgates."
4,Silco,Jinx,"And now, we're cut off."
4,Silco,Jinx,The topsiders are leaving us further and further behind.
4,Silco,Jinx,What happened?
4,Jinx,Silco,She already told you.
4,Silco,Jinx,I'm asking you.
4,Jinx,Silco,One of those Firelight wackos was a girl.
4,Jinx,Silco,With pink hair.
4,Silco,Jinx,Hmm...
4,Silco,Jinx,Your sister's gone.
4,Silco,Jinx,You know that as well as I do.
4,Jinx,Silco,"I know. I know. Sisters, right?"
4,Jinx,Silco,"You can't live with 'em, can't stuff 'em back in the ol' babymaker."
4,Silco,Jinx,Today's screw-up will set us back weeks.
4,Jinx,Silco,I'm sorry.
4,Silco,Jinx,I need to know that I can rely on you.
4,Jinx,Silco,Phew.
4,Silco,Jinx,"I'm doing this for us, Jinx. All of us."
4,Silco,Jinx,The sons and daughters of Zaun deserve more than their runoff.
4,Jinx,Silco,It won't happen again.
4,Silco,Jinx,I know.
4,Silco,Jinx,Sevika will clean up today's mess.
4,Jinx,Silco,Sevika? That ogre couldn't clean a dust bunny with a blowtorch.
4,Silco,Jinx,She'll suffice. You should focus on your gadgetry.
4,Jinx,Silco,Ugh.
4,Silco,Jinx,Take some time.
4,Jinx,Silco,I don't need time.
4,Silco,Jinx,Take it anyhow.
4,Elora,Mel,Fundraiser's going well.
4,Elora,Mel,Your mother would be proud.
4,Mel,Elora,Hmm... Would she?
4,Elora,Mel,Tired of mingling?
4,Mel,Elora,Hmm. These people have nothing new to offer me.
4,Mel,Elora,The only one actually worth my time is him.
4,Elora,Mel,The golden boy.
4,Mel,Elora,"Ah, he's won Piltover's heart."
4,Elora,Mel,"Oh, speak of the devil."
4,Jayce,Mel,Could I borrow you for a minute?
4,Mel,Jayce,To what do I owe the pleasure?
4,Jayce,Mel,It's Heimerdinger.
4,Mel,Jayce,When is it not?
4,Jayce,Mel,We've shown him our research.
4,Jayce,Mel,He thinks we need more time.
4,Mel,Jayce,It's Progress Day.
4,Mel,Jayce,Representatives from all over the world
4,Mel,Jayce,have come to see what new wonders the City of Progress has to offer.
4,Mel,Jayce,"If there's a time to present a new creation, it is now."
4,Jayce,Mel,Great.
4,Mel,Jayce,Heimerdinger is a great scientist. But he's old. He only ever sees the past.
4,Mel,Jayce,Piltover needs a leader who looks forward.
4,Mel,Jayce,Someone like you.
4,Jayce,Mel,You really believe that?
4,Mel,Jayce,Hextech has the potential to change everything.
4,Mel,Jayce,The world is ready.
4,Mel,Jayce,And I've already spoken to several potential investors.
4,Jayce,Mel,Investors?
4,Mel,Jayce,Of course.
4,Mel,Jayce,Everyone wants Hextech for themselves.
4,Mel,Jayce,It's your speech.
4,Mel,Jayce,Give the people a glimpse of the future.
4,Jinx,Jinx,It wasn't her.
4,Jinx,Jinx,It wasn't.
4,Jinx,Jinx,I know. Just... just some wannabe street trash.
4,Jinx,Jinx,"I got confused, that's all."
4,Jinx,Jinx,"Now, he thinks I'm weak."
4,Jinx,Jinx,Sevika will clean it up.
4,Jinx,Jinx,Sevika's a regular Johnny-on-the-spot.
4,Jinx,Jinx,I'm not weak.
4,Jinx,Jinx,And I'm gonna show him.
4,Jinx,Jinx,"Oh, I'm gonna show him. You'll see."
4,Viktor,Jayce,Where were you?
4,Viktor,Jayce,They were asking if I could do the address.
4,Jayce,Viktor,You should come up with me. We're partners.
4,Viktor,Jayce,"No, no. Not in front of all of them..."
4,Viktor,Jayce,You... have your speech prepared?
4,Jayce,Viktor,Uh-huh.
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,An inspiration to Piltover's future
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,and that of all humanity.
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,Please join me in welcoming to the stage...
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,Jayce Talis.
4,Jayce,Viktor,Guess it's time.
4,Jayce,,"Uh, good evening."
4,Jayce,,I know many of you probably didn't expect to see me here today.
4,Jayce,,"And believe me, I'm just as shocked as you are."
4,Jayce,,"My family and I are simple people. In our factory, we made hammers."
4,Jayce,,They were probably used to cut the stones you're standing on right now.
4,Jayce,,No one in my life expected very much of me.
4,Jayce,,And that is precisely what makes this moment so extraordinary.
4,Jayce,,"A few years ago, the Hexgates opened their ports to the world"
4,Jayce,,and made Piltover prosper beyond anything we could have ever imagined.
4,Jayce,,But... we're not done yet.
4,Jayce,,"This year, we've created something new for you."
4,Jayce,,Something that... um...
4,Jayce,,That we will share with you...
4,Jayce,,...when the time is right.
4,Jayce,,Things that will bring an end to your hardships.
4,Jayce,,"Whether you're the scion of our high houses,"
4,Jayce,,or an honest laborer from the underground.
4,Jayce,,"We vow to keep pressing forward, for we are the City of Progress."
4,Jayce,,And our future is bright.
4,,,"That it, then?"
4,,,I thought that Talis boy was some kind of genius.
4,Guard 1,,"Last year, didn't he launch a blimp halfway across the continent?"
4,Caitlyn,Guard 1,"Airship, actually."
4,Caitlyn,Guard 1,An airship has a rigid metal hull. It's not a blimp.
4,,,"It's a balloon, ain't it?"
4,,,Sure as hell looks that way.
4,,,"Pardon us, if we aren't quite so refined as you, milady."
4,,,"What are you even doing here, Kiramman?"
4,,,Don't you have a cocktail party to attend?
4,Caitlyn,,Fire.
4,Caitlyn,,Fire!
4,,,What's happening?
4,Caitlyn,,Get the fire brigade.
4,Jinx,,"Help. In here, please. Help me."
4,Jinx,,"Help. It's so hot, please. I'm trapped."
4,Jinx,,I'm a helpless little girl and I've set the building on fire.
4,Jinx,,By accident. Totally by accident.
4,Caitlyn,,Get out. Now.
4,Jinx,,"Also, I brought this dynamite. Goodbye."
4,Viktor,,The gemstone is gone. Along with some of our research papers.
4,Marcus,,The situation is still developing. No one in the undercity has claimed responsibility yet.
4,Heimerdinger,,How did it come to this?
4,,,Hmm. For too long has the underground been left unchecked.
4,,,We've lost touch.
4,,,They may not be your preferred constituents but they're still our people.
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,The undercity cannot be controlled. Not by us.
4,,,So where does that leave us?
4,,,Mr. Talis?
4,,,Could the trenchers build a weapon with the stolen crystal?
4,,,"Shimmer, body replacements..."
4,,,"We've seen their ingenuity over the years, of course, they can."
4,Jayce,,"If the right person got a hold of it,"
4,Jayce,,it's possible they could utilize its energy.
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,We need to address this immediately.
4,Jayce,,I agree.
4,Jayce,,It was my responsibility to safeguard this technology and I failed.
4,Jayce,,My mistake cost people their lives.
4,Jayce,,I have come before you to recommend that we suspend all Hextech operations
4,Jayce,,until the situation is resolved.
4,Jayce,,"Including our laboratories, the refinery and the Hexgates."
4,,,Have you lost your mind?
4,,,The Hexgates must remain open.
4,,,Piltover's status as a global shipping lane depends on it.
4,,,Thousands would lose their income.
4,Jayce,,But shouldn't the safety of Piltover be our first priority?
4,Heimerdinger,,You would sacrifice your life's work?
4,,,"Without the Hexgates, my goods cannot reach foreign markets till winter."
4,,,Am I to tell the Noxians
4,,,their next shipment of wine will be vinegar?
4,Mel,,Councilors. It appears we are at an impasse.
4,Mel,,"If we shut down the Hexgates, the city will suffer."
4,Mel,,"But if we do nothing,"
4,Mel,,we leave ourselves vulnerable to malefactors.
4,Mel,,More lives may be lost.
4,Mel,,Perhaps the time has come to explore a more radical solution.
4,Mrs. Kiramann,,What are you suggesting?
4,Mel,,Mr. Talis has demonstrated his commitment to our safety.
4,Mel,,He's willing to sacrifice his own enterprise.
4,Mel,,And it seems to me only Mr. Talis
4,Mel,,has the knowledge necessary to secure the Hexgates.
4,Mel,,"I propose that a new chair be brought forth,"
4,Mel,,and that House Talis be elevated to this august body.
4,Jayce,,What?
4,Mel,,"As a Councilor,"
4,Mel,,he will have the resources necessary to protect all our investments.
4,,,"Councilor Medarda, his is highly irregular."
4,,,The Council has held seven seats for generations.
4,,,Does the boy have any experience?
4,Mel,,Only that of a scientist. Like Heimerdinger.
4,Heimerdinger,,I believe Councilor Medarda is right.
4,Heimerdinger,,Hextech security should be administered by a scientist.
4,Heimerdinger,,I second the motion.
4,Mel,,"Well then, shall we vote?"
4,Silco,Jinx,Jinx!
4,Silco,Jinx,Jinx! Jinx!
4,Silco,Jinx,Jinx!
4,Jinx,Silco,That's me.
4,Silco,Jinx,"Half a dozen enforcers, dead. Enforcers. Dead."
4,Jinx,Silco,Yeah...
4,Silco,Jinx,A building blown to pieces.
4,Jinx,Silco,"Oh, yeah."
4,Silco,Jinx,Do you have any idea what you've done?
4,Jinx,Silco,"Actually, I do."
4,Jinx,Silco,Happy Progress Day!
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,Hey.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,How are you feeling?
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,I've had a break in the case.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,Shouldn't you be resting?
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,While the trail is hot?
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,"Listen, you know how I've suspected"
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,there is a single mind behind the undercity's violence?
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,The great conspiracy.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,I think whoever attacked the square is our suspect.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,The same symbols showed up at the botched smuggling operation at the Hexgates.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,The Hexgates?
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,Keep up.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,"All this time, they've kept their dealings localized to the undercity."
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,Low priority. The attack on the square changes things.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,They've overstepped.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,"If I can figure who made this,"
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,it could lead me directly to whoever's behind it all.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,"The answer is here, staring me in the face."
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,I can feel it.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,How do you intend to prove any of this?
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,If I can just work this out. Marcus will have to listen.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,"If there's one thing I've learned about the Council,"
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,they need more than just theories.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,Since when did you concern yourself with the Council's opinion?
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,Since I...
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,became a Councilor.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,You're serious.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,When? Why?
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,Have they discovered how to govern with grease and a spanner?
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,Ha ha. I was actually hoping you might consider joining my staff.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,House Talis Security.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,That's a ceremonial position. I'd live behind a desk.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,"You almost died, Cait."
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,I just... I just want you to be safe.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,"Thanks, but I already have a job."
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,No. You don't.
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,"After the attack, your parents spoke to the Sheriff."
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,This is the best I could do.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,"I don't need charity, Councilor. Yours or my parents'."
4,Jayce,Caitlyn,Cait.
4,Caitlyn,Jayce,Get out.
4,Caitlyn,guard,I need to speak with one of the inmates.
4,,,"Oh, folks in here aren't usually very talkative."
4,Caitlyn,guard,This one was hit by friendly fire.
4,Caitlyn,guard,He's got reason to talk. Must have been sent in today?
4,,,Oh. Inmate 2135.
4,Caitlyn,guard,Why not?
4,,,"Uh, well, there's been..."
4,Caitlyn,guard,"You don't understand, I have to talk to him."
4,Caitlyn,guard,Who assaulted him?
4,Vi,Caitlyn,Who the hell are you?
,,,
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,Hmm.
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,"That was quite some shooting, Kiramman."
5,Caitlyn,Grayson,Did my parents pay you to let me win?
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,Hmm... That's a serious accusation.
5,Caitlyn,Grayson,"You held your shot, I saw you."
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,The trophy is yours. You earned it.
5,Caitlyn,Grayson,You haven't answered my question.
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,"No, your parents didn't pay me."
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,I just thought you deserved it.
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,I'm an enforcer.
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,"For me, knowing how to handle this weapon means being able to protect people."
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,To be of service to the city. And that's trophy enough.
5,Grayson,Caitlyn,"Begs the question, young Kiramman. What are you shooting for?"
5,Caitlyn,Vi,I took a look at your file.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,There's no record of you or your crimes. What are you here for?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,My sunny personality.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,You attacked an inmate. Why?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Why not?
5,Caitlyn,Vi,He was a witness in an ongoing investigation.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"Hmm, bummer."
5,Caitlyn,Vi,This was a waste of time.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Couldn't have put it better.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"Hey, give Silco a kiss on that winning eye of his, will you?"
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Silco? The industrialist?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"Okay, this is getting old."
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"Can you just send in whoever's gonna kick the shit out of me,"
5,Vi,Caitlyn,so I can get on with my night?
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Does this mean anything to you?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Where did you get this?
5,Caitlyn,Vi,My question first. He worked for Silco?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"Uh, they all do."
5,Vi,Caitlyn,How can anyone not know that? Where did you find this?
5,Caitlyn,Vi,There was an attack. This is evidence.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,I need proof if I'm to believe what you're saying about Silco.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,I could get it for you. Just not from in here.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,In what mad world would I trust someone like you?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Someone like me?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,You enforcers are all the same. Just asshole criminals in fancy uniforms.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,You know what? Find Silco yourself.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,"I will, thank you."
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Hmm... Undercity's gonna eat you alive.
5,Caitlyn,guard,"I've got orders from Councilor Talis, concerning Inmate 516."
5,guard,Caitlyn,"Not cooperative, huh?"
5,guard,Caitlyn,"You, uh, you want us to have a chat with her?"
5,Caitlyn,guard,No.
5,guard,Caitlyn,Oh.
5,Caitlyn,guard,It's for her release.
5,guard,Caitlyn,Huh. Since when's he a Councilor?
5,Caitlyn,guard,Since today.
5,Caitlyn,guard,How many chats have you had with her?
5,guard,Caitlyn,"You know, I never even thought to count."
5,Marcus,,These brave Enforcers sacrificed their lives
5,Marcus,,to defend the values of our great city.
5,Marcus,,"To some, they are mothers..."
5,Marcus,,"fathers, sons..."
5,Marcus,,daughters...
5,Marcus,,"but to all, they are heroes."
5,,,"Who was this, Daddy?"
5,Marcus,,A good woman.
5,Marcus,Silco,You said you could control her. I lost six officers. Six!
5,Marcus,Silco,She pushed it too far this time. The Council's up in arms.
5,Marcus,Silco,I can't make this go away for you unless you give me something to work with.
5,Marcus,Silco,Arresting her would be doing you a favor.
5,Silco,Marcus,I don't need favors.
5,Silco,Marcus,I need you to do your job.
5,Silco,Marcus,The Firelights have been a thorn in both our sides.
5,Silco,Marcus,They ambushed my shipment at the Hexgates on the same day as the attack.
5,Silco,Marcus,It seems to me the Council has its culprit.
5,Marcus,Silco,"Oh, that's tidy for you."
5,Marcus,Silco,What if I'm not interested in playing along?
5,Silco,Marcus,"We've accomplished a lot together, Marcus. Sheriff."
5,Silco,Marcus,And there is more yet to achieve.
5,Silco,Marcus,I hope you can remain a part of it.
5,Silco,Marcus,"For their families. From an anonymous, concerned citizen."
5,Jayce,Viktor,Yesterday's smuggling fiasco was nothing.
5,Jayce,Viktor,"These manifests are full of discrepancies, dating back months."
5,Viktor,Jayce,This is a poor use of our time.
5,Jayce,Viktor,"I'm a Councilor now, Viktor."
5,Jayce,Viktor,It's my responsibility to make sure the Hexgates are safe and protected.
5,Viktor,Jayce,"What about our pledge to improve lives, for those in need? For the undercity?"
5,Jayce,Viktor,"Look, I'm sorry I didn't announce our other projects in my speech."
5,Jayce,Viktor,"Soon, we can do everything we..."
5,Viktor,Jayce,Soon?
5,Viktor,Jayce,"There are people who need our help now, Jayce."
5,Marcus,Jayce,You wanted to see me?
5,Jayce,Marcus,Have your people ever reviewed these logs?
5,Marcus,Jayce,"Mr. Talis, I assure you..."
5,Jayce,Marcus,Councilor.
5,Jayce,Marcus,And the only assurance I need is that
5,Jayce,Marcus,you will search and seize any unauthorized merchandise.
5,Jayce,Marcus,I've made a list of suspicious transactions.
5,Marcus,Jayce,"All due respect, Councilor,"
5,Marcus,Jayce,today's your first day...
5,Jayce,Marcus,Second.
5,Marcus,Jayce,Right.
5,Marcus,Jayce,You sure you don't want to confer with the other Councilors before...
5,Jayce,Marcus,"This corruption runs deep, Sheriff."
5,Jayce,Marcus,I intend to root it out.
5,Jayce,Marcus,Have you made any progress with the stolen Gemstone?
5,Marcus,Jayce,Yes. Chief suspect is an undercity gang.
5,Marcus,Jayce,They call themselves the Firelights.
5,Marcus,Jayce,"They operate like phantoms,"
5,Marcus,Jayce,doing hit-and-runs on civilians and disappearing into the night.
5,Jayce,Marcus,How soon till we track them down?
5,Marcus,Jayce,I've got my best officers on it.
5,Jayce,Viktor,Viktor? You all right?
5,Viktor,Jayce,A... a headache. I just... I need to get to the lab.
5,Jinx,,Boring...
5,Jinx,,Boring. Wow. Super boring...
5,Jinx,,Here we go!
5,Jinx,,It's all about these runes.
5,Jinx,Jinx,"They form some kind of math-y, magic-y gateway."
5,Jinx,Jinx,To the realm of heebie-jeebies. And this... Turns it on.
5,Jinx,Jinx,So... here goes.
5,Jinx,Jinx,No!
5,Jinx,Jinx,No! It was a mistake! It was a mistake.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,I heard the bathysphere has a nice view.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,That could be a good way to get a lay of the land.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Too risky.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,What...
5,Vi,grunt,Nice jacket.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Welcome to the Lanes.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,You almost got me killed.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,My little sister could do that when she was seven.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,All us fissure folk can. Don't you want to blend in?
5,Jayce,Viktor,You had a vision?
5,Viktor,Jayce,What if we've been looking at it backwards?
5,Viktor,Jayce,We've been trying to discover runes that invoke specific effects
5,Viktor,Jayce,and then molding them to a useful function.
5,Viktor,Jayce,"Tools, as you like to put it. But, but..."
5,Viktor,Jayce,"If the legends are true, mages aren't bound to single functions."
5,Viktor,Jayce,It's said the Arcane speaks through them.
5,Jayce,Viktor,I'm still not following.
5,Viktor,Jayce,They think. They adapt.
5,Jayce,Viktor,You think Hextech can... learn?
5,Jayce,Viktor,Are you sure this is safe?
5,Viktor,Jayce,Of course not.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"Oh, Jericho! Have I missed these."
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Hmm?
5,Caitlyn,Vi,No. Thank you.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,You're missing out.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Are you going to question him?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,About what? The meat?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Definitely not above board.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Silco. His connections? Isn't that why we're here?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,We're here because I'm hungry. Do you know what prison food is like?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"No, of course, you don't."
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Unbelievable. I didn't break you out of jail to eat... slop.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,"I knew this was a terrible idea. You don't actually know anything, do you?"
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Mm. Better than I remember.
5,Jayce,,Hmm.
5,Jayce,Mel,I haven't been here in years.
5,Jayce,Mel,Since my parents brought me for the winter fest.
5,Mel,Jayce,We're not here for the performance. Your House is in trouble.
5,Mel,Jayce,That merchant formerly enjoyed certain leniencies
5,Mel,Jayce,with regard to her trade in exchange for her generous Academy patronage.
5,Jayce,Mel,By leniencies you mean corruption?
5,Mel,Jayce,"Hmm, Amara's harmless."
5,Mel,Jayce,"Oh, look at those two stooges."
5,Jayce,Mel,Councilors Hoskel and Salo. Don't they hate each other?
5,Mel,Jayce,"Hmm. But they share a taste for the finer Noxian spirits,"
5,Mel,Jayce,technically an illegal import.
5,Jayce,Mel,I tightened our security.
5,Mel,Jayce,"And in so doing, put a target on your back."
5,Mel,Jayce,There are those who covet your power over the wealth the Hexgates afford.
5,Mel,Jayce,And would take any opportunity to seize it from you.
5,Mel,Jayce,"You've just made yourself everyone's common enemy, Jayce."
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Hmm.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,"Well, that place does look like it has bodies buried in the basement."
5,Vi,Caitlyn,You don't know anything.
5,Jayce,Mel,I can't compromise the safety of the Hexgates for collateral.
5,Mel,Jayce,No one's asking you to. These are simply favors amongst friends.
5,Jayce,Mel,I never wanted anything to do with politics. You pushed this on me.
5,Mel,Jayce,"You're a symbol of the future now, Jayce, whether you like it or not."
5,Mel,Jayce,With that comes the potential to shape your own destiny.
5,Mel,Jayce,The Council assumes you'll fail. Time to prove them all wrong. Once again.
5,Mel,Amara,"Welcome, Amara. How's little Rohan?"
5,Amara,,Councilor Medarda. Councilor Talis.
5,Mel,Amara,He's just as precocious as ever.
5,Amara,Mel,I had quite a shock this morning. Enforcers banging on my door.
5,Mel,Amara,"Oh, I hope you'll understand, Jayce had to make a show of safety."
5,Mel,Amara,But he's here now to negotiate all his deals personally.
5,Mel,Amara,Councilor Talis is willing to reinstate former trade privileges
5,Mel,Amara,to those who share his vision.
5,Mel,Amara,Can we count you amongst them?
5,Amara,Mel,Councilor Bolbok seems to think other arrangements would be more profitable.
5,Mel,Amara,The man's a fool.
5,Mel,Amara,"With him, you'd be investing in the past."
5,Mel,Amara,"With us, you'd be investing in the future."
5,Jayce,Amara,"You know, Councilor Medarda's right. The Hexgates are only the beginning."
5,Jayce,Amara,"In fact, we're currently looking for new partners in our Hextech research,"
5,Jayce,Amara,"and as a supporter of House Talis,"
5,Jayce,Amara,you'd be the first in line to any of our advancements.
5,Amara,Jayce,How can I say no to such an auspicious offer?
5,Mel,Jayce,Hextech partners?
5,Jayce,Mel,"Has a nice ring, doesn't it?"
5,Mel,Jayce,"Mm. Your audience awaits, Councilor."
5,Elora,Mel,He's been quite the investment.
5,Mel,Elora,Indeed. Better than expected.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,The one place all the secrets are spilled.
5,,,Oh.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,How exactly do you propose we go about this?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Let 'em think you work here.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Excuse me?
5,Caitlyn,Vi,I will not.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,You know what your problem is?
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Please. Tell me.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,You expect everyone to give you what you want.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"If you really want people to talk to you,"
5,Vi,Caitlyn,you have to let them think you have what they want.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,And what do I have?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"You're hot, cupcake."
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"So what'll it be, man or woman?"
5,Pim,Caitlyn,Um...
5,Pim,Caitlyn,Hi.
5,Pim,Caitlyn,I'm Pim. What's your name?
5,Vi,Pim,Matilda. But you can call her whatever you want.
5,Caitlyn,Pim,"Ah, yes. Matilda."
5,Caitlyn,Pim,My parents named me Matilda.
5,Caitlyn,Pim,"After my great-grandmother Matilda, the, uh..."
5,,,Would you believe it?
5,Silco,Marcus,"Sheriff, what a lovely surprise."
5,Marcus,Silco,"The Hextech wonder boy is on the Council now,"
5,Marcus,Silco,and he's asking questions.
5,Marcus,Silco,It's only a matter of time before he finds the truth.
5,Silco,Marcus,"What is truth, but a survivor's story?"
5,Marcus,Silco,"If I'm discovered, we're both finished."
5,Silco,Marcus,Good thing you've located proof of the Firelights' involvement.
5,Marcus,Silco,This has gone too far.
5,Silco,Marcus,Hmm? Imagining yourself a hero?
5,Silco,Marcus,One final act to make you the martyr you've always seen yourself as?
5,Silco,Marcus,Then what are you waiting for?
5,Silco,Jinx,"Ah, he's faltering."
5,Silco,Jinx,You need to weaponize the Hextech soon.
5,Silco,Jinx,"Once we've cracked their prize, topside will have no power over us."
5,Jinx,Silco,I can't do it. Just... give it to the doctor.
5,Silco,Jinx,"You're the only one I can trust with this, Jinx."
5,Jinx,Silco,I keep... seeing them. That day.
5,Silco,Jinx,"Fear haunts us all, child."
5,informant,Vi,"Sweetheart, I was real sad to hear about Vander."
5,informant,Vi,And the kids. Just terrible.
5,Vi,informant,"By the looks of it, no one down here lifted a finger to stop Silco."
5,informant,Vi,A few tried but Silco's got the muscle... and the money.
5,informant,Vi,He took over the Last Drop.
5,Vi,informant,I saw.
5,informant,Vi,Things have changed without Vander looking out for us.
5,Vi,informant,Have you heard anything about Powder? I think Silco has her.
5,Vi,informant,I have to find her.
5,informant,Vi,Silco's number two's a regular.
5,informant,Vi,I can have Miguel tell you where to find her.
5,Vi,informant,I owe you.
5,informant,Vi,It's nothing.
5,,,I've only ever imagined the gardens...
5,,,This is all I've seen.
5,Mel,Jayce,You did well today.
5,Jayce,Mel,I had a good teacher.
5,Mel,Jayce,It's only a matter of time before those old fools on the Council
5,Mel,Jayce,officially accept your research.
5,Jayce,Mel,"My father put hammers in the hands of the people,"
5,Jayce,Mel,and they built this magnificent city.
5,Jayce,Mel,Imagine the wonders they could create if we put magic in their hands.
5,Mel,Jayce,The world will never be the same.
5,Mel,Jayce,The Medardas usually only take from the world.
5,Mel,Jayce,We're not often in the position to give anything back.
5,Jayce,Mel,I couldn't have done it without you.
5,Viktor,,Hmm.
5,Sky,Viktor,It's beautiful.
5,Viktor,Sky,I can't figure out why it's not working.
5,Sky,Viktor,You will.
5,Sky,Viktor,Are you headed home soon? I thought we could walk together.
5,Viktor,Sky,"I'm, uh, probably going to sleep here tonight."
5,Sky,Viktor,"Again? You know there's always tomorrow, right?"
5,Viktor,Sky,"Good night, Miss Young."
5,,,Mm.
5,Silco,Jinx,I almost drowned in these waters.
5,Jinx,Silco,You told me a million times.
5,Silco,Jinx,Vander wasn't the man you thought he was.
5,Jinx,Silco,"Right, he was like a brother to you,"
5,Jinx,Silco,"and he turned his back and blah, blah, blah."
5,Jinx,Silco,Did I miss anything?
5,Silco,Jinx,I've got a new one for you.
5,Silco,Jinx,"That day, I let a weak man die."
5,Silco,Jinx,And another was reborn.
5,Silco,Jinx,"Betrayal, that pain that feels like it'll eat you from the inside out,"
5,Silco,Jinx,can either break you or forge you into something greater.
5,Silco,Jinx,You need to let Powder die.
5,Silco,Jinx,So the fear of pain will no longer control you.
5,Silco,Jinx,You're strong now. Just like you were always meant to be.
5,Silco,Jinx,Jinx is perfect.
5,Viktor,Jayce,Jayce?
5,Jayce,Viktor,"Viktor, the doctors, um, they said you're..."
5,Viktor,Jayce,How much time do I have?
5,Sevika,,"Rotten luck, boys!"
5,Sevika,Vi,Vi?
5,Vi,Sevika,You filthy traitor.
5,Sevika,Vi,Vander had his chance.
5,Sevika,Vi,I see you never learned patience.
5,Vi,Sevika,Where's my sister? Where's he keeping her?
5,Sevika,Vi,Keeping her? You mean Jinx?
5,Sevika,Vi,She works for him.
5,Sevika,Vi,She's like his daughter.
5,Sevika,Vi,I'll give her your regards.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Why did you let her go?
5,Caitlyn,Vi,"Do you ever say ""thank you?"""
5,Vi,Caitlyn,He's gonna know we're here now.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Whose fault is that?
5,Vi,Caitlyn,You're an all-right shot.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,I'm an excellent shot.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,"You gonna help me out, cupcake?"
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Stop calling me that. My name is Caitlyn.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,But you're so sweet.
5,Vi,Caitlyn,Like a cupcake.
5,Caitlyn,Vi,Shut up.
5,Silco,Sevika,You're making a mess.
5,Sevika,Silco,The sister.
5,Sevika,Silco,She's back.
5,Silco,Sevika,From the dead?
,,,
6,,,Whoo!
6,,,"Come over here, come on!"
6,,,Sky?
6,Singed,Viktor,Don't be afraid.
6,Singed,Viktor,You built this?
6,Singed,Viktor,Why aren't you playing with the others?
6,Singed,Viktor,Hm.
6,Singed,Viktor,Loneliness is often the byproduct of a gifted mind.
6,Viktor,Singed,What is it?
6,Singed,Viktor,Hmm? Oh. This is Rio.
6,Singed,Viktor,She's a rare mutation that I cultivated.
6,Singed,Viktor,Here.
6,Singed,Viktor,Go on.
6,Singed,Viktor,Hmm.
6,Singed,Viktor,She's dying.
6,Singed,Viktor,I'm attempting to prevent that. The mutation must survive.
6,Viktor,Singed,Can I help?
6,Singed,Viktor,You want to assist me?
6,Singed,Viktor,Very well.
6,Singed,Viktor,We can be loners together.
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,Good to see some things haven't changed.
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,Seems just yesterday I stumbled upon an aspiring young scholar
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,"from the undercity here,"
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,ruminating in his steel oasis.
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,I heard your prognosis.
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,"I'm terribly sorry, my boy."
6,Viktor,Heimerdinger,"Do you contemplate death, Professor?"
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,Only that of friends.
6,Viktor,Heimerdinger,I suppose your legacy has been well-secured.
6,Viktor,Heimerdinger,"As one of Piltover's founders,"
6,Viktor,Heimerdinger,what haven't you to show for your remarkable life?
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,"You should be proud of what you've accomplished, Viktor."
6,Viktor,Heimerdinger,Figments.
6,Viktor,Heimerdinger,"My contributions will be short-lived, even in your memory."
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,I have seen many students.
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,It's a sad truth that those who shine brightest often burn fastest.
6,Jayce,Mel,I didn't know you were an artist.
6,Mel,Jayce,Hm. There's quite a lot about me you don't know.
6,Jayce,Mel,"Listen, I'm sorry for disappearing last night."
6,Mel,Jayce,Duty calls.
6,Jayce,Mel,Viktor's dying.
6,Jayce,Mel,I think it has something to do with gasses in the fissures where he grew up.
6,Jayce,Mel,Exactly the sort of thing we wanted to fix with Hextech.
6,Jayce,Mel,"Improving lives. Solving real issues, not just trade disputes."
6,Jayce,Mel,Viktor saved my life once.
6,Jayce,Mel,"Now, he needs me and there's nothing I can do."
6,Jayce,Mel,I hate feeling so useless.
6,Mel,Jayce,I didn't realize you were so close.
6,Jayce,Mel,He's like my brother.
6,Mel,Jayce,Why did you come to me with this?
6,Jayce,Mel,I just...
6,Jayce,Mel,Nothing feels impossible when I'm with you.
6,Mel,Jayce,I'm an exile from my family.
6,Jayce,Mel,What?
6,Jayce,Mel,Why?
6,Mel,Jayce,I fell short of Medarda standards.
6,Jayce,Mel,I don't believe that for a second.
6,Jayce,Mel,Do you?
6,Mel,Jayce,"You should be with him, Jayce."
6,Mel,Jayce,"We can't change what fate has in store for us,"
6,Mel,Jayce,but we don't have to face it alone.
6,Jayce,Mel,It's a beautiful painting.
6,Jinx,Thieram,Chuck!
6,Thieram,Jinx,Thieram. Uh... My name's Thieram.
6,Jinx,Thieram,"Nice try, Chuck."
6,Jinx,Thieram,What's all the hubbub?
6,Thieram,Jinx,Uh. Boss wants us to grab someone up.
6,Jinx,Thieram,Someone? Anyone?
6,Jinx,Thieram,Who are you grabbing?
6,Thieram,Jinx,Some girls.
6,Thieram,Jinx,"I mean, I mean not... I'm not grabbing girls."
6,Thieram,Jinx,"Oh, other than the... those ones... I guess."
6,Jinx,Thieram,Focus. Who are they? Why wasn't I invited to the party?
6,Thieram,Jinx,"Uh, I don't know."
6,Thieram,Jinx,They... they got in a fight with Sevika. They did a number on her.
6,Jinx,Thieram,Oh really? Which number?
6,Thieram,Jinx,It's like a saying...
6,Jinx,Thieram,"You're doing great, Chuck."
6,Jinx,Thieram,"Here, for your troubles."
6,Caitlyn,Vi,Silco's goons aren't far behind.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,We have to keep moving.
6,Vi,Caitlyn,What the hell is that?
6,Caitlyn,Vi,The sign.
6,Vi,Caitlyn,"Never mind, just help me to the edge."
6,Caitlyn,Vi,Can you do this in your...
6,Caitlyn,,Shit.
6,,,Come on!
6,,,Come on. Let's go!
6,Sevika,Silco,We lost her.
6,Jinx,Sevika,Lost who?
6,Jinx,Sevika,I feel like you and I got off on the wrong arm.
6,Jinx,Sevika,Maybe we should try the other.
6,Sevika,Jinx,No need. It's your sister.
6,Sevika,Jinx,She's back. She's looking for you.
6,Sevika,Jinx,It's not what you think.
6,Sevika,Jinx,She's with some girl enforcer. Guess she replaced you.
6,Jinx,Sevika,You're lying!
6,Sevika,Jinx,Why bother?
6,Sevika,Jinx,"Her back in town, it's only a matter of time before you implode"
6,Sevika,Jinx,and Silco finally gets the message
6,Sevika,Jinx,that you're about as good for our cause as you were for your family.
6,Sevika,Jinx,Jinx.
6,Jinx,Sevika,"Ten outta ten, toots!"
6,Jinx,Sevika,I think I know just how to deliver that message.
6,Silco,Ren,"Ah, about time Daddy joined us."
6,Silco,Marcus,"You were so busy, little Ren here saw me in."
6,Marcus,Silco,Let's talk outside.
6,Silco,Marcus,Can't you see we're playing?
6,Silco,Marcus,"You remember our old friend Vi, don't you?"
6,Silco,Ren,Vander's daughter. She was about your age.
6,Silco,Ren,Her father went on a long trip and Daddy here assured me that she left with him.
6,Silco,Ren,But it seems she never made it. Isn't that sad?
6,Silco,Ren,Could you imagine being separated from your father?
6,Marcus,Silco,She's... in a safe place.
6,Silco,Marcus,She's in the Lanes.
6,Marcus,Silco,That's not possible.
6,Silco,Marcus,There's an enforcer with her. A girl. Roughly the same age.
6,Marcus,Silco,"Caitlyn. She's a Kiramman. Just like them, she does whatever she wants."
6,Marcus,Silco,I... can't control her.
6,Silco,Marcus,Then of what use are you?
6,Marcus,Silco,I'll track her down.
6,Marcus,Silco,I can fix this.
6,Marcus,Silco,Please.
6,Silco,Marcus,"Everyone makes mistakes, right?"
6,Silco,Marcus,What's important is that we don't repeat them.
6,Silco,Marcus,My people are tracking Vi and this...
6,Silco,Marcus,...Caitlyn. They cannot be allowed to resurface.
6,Silco,Marcus,Do we understand each other?
6,Marcus,Silco,Hmm.
6,,,Hmm.
6,Silco,Ren,Oops. Ah. So sorry. Accidents happen.
6,Viktor,Jayce,Watch.
6,Viktor,Jayce,It responds to organic matter.
6,Jayce,Viktor,Incredible.
6,Viktor,Jayce,"This is unlike anything we've ever seen, Jayce."
6,Viktor,Jayce,"It, it, it could be the key to augmenting physiology, extending life..."
6,Jayce,Viktor,Curing you.
6,Viktor,Jayce,It's happened to everyone.
6,Viktor,Jayce,I can't determine why.
6,Viktor,Jayce,They're... rejecting the transmutation.
6,Jayce,Viktor,We'll solve this.
6,Viktor,Jayce,There may not be time.
6,Viktor,Jayce,We're in uncharted waters here and...
6,Viktor,Jayce,I can feel my body... eroding.
6,Jayce,Viktor,I'll have Sky bring Heimerdinger. He might know something that could help.
6,Jayce,Viktor,"In the meantime, we'll do what we do best."
6,Caitlyn,Vi,What is this place?
6,Vi,Caitlyn,It's where the kind of people you topsiders
6,Vi,Caitlyn,"don't want to think about, wind up."
6,Vi,Caitlyn,"It was never this big, though."
6,Vi,Caitlyn,There.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,"I know you have your reservations about me,"
6,Caitlyn,Vi,but this only works if we can trust each other.
6,Vi,Caitlyn,It doesn't work. It never has.
6,Vi,Caitlyn,You topsiders always find a way to screw us.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,I suppose topside is to blame for all your misfortunes.
6,Vi,Caitlyn,No.
6,Vi,Caitlyn,Not all of them.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,"We aren't monsters, you know. We're people, just like you."
6,Vi,Caitlyn,You don't know anything about me.
6,Vi,Caitlyn,I shouldn't have left you.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,"It's all right. Despite it all, I can tell..."
6,Caitlyn,Vi,you have a good heart.
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,What is that?
6,Viktor,Heimerdinger,I'm calling it the Hexcore.
6,Viktor,Heimerdinger,It's an adaptive rune matrix. Hextech that evolves.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,It's groundbreaking.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,What's most exciting is that it reacts to biological matter.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,There are stories of healing magic. Our samples thus far have perished...
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,You must destroy it.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,What?
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Please, if ever you've put faith in my guidance, hear me now."
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,I've seen nations destroyed by a single seed and it looked...
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,exactly like this.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"Professor, this could save Viktor's life."
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,"Viktor, something's different. You've changed. What did you do?"
6,Viktor,Heimerdinger,"What do you mean, Professor?"
6,Heimerdinger,Viktor,It's that thing. It must be destroyed!
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,Wait.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,No. I won't let you.
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Jayce, this is a violation of the Ethos."
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,I will have it destroyed one way or another.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,That's your opinion. We'll see if the Council agrees.
6,Viktor,Jayce,I might know someone else who could help.
6,Jayce,Viktor,You do what you have to. I need to get ready.
6,Viktor,Jayce,For what?
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,Is she all right?
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,"Wait, wait, wait! Easy. Easy."
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,"That's Vi, right?"
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,I'm a friend.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,"Or at least I was. I mean, I... I owed her old man my life."
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,Probably more than that.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,I guess.
6,Caitlyn,shimmer addict,She's bleeding. She needs a doctor.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,Not so simple to come by around here.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,Hey.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,I'm sorry.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,"Oh, oh. But, ah, I do know someone else who might be able to help."
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,Come with me.
6,apothecary,shimmer addict,Ailment?
6,Caitlyn,apothecary,Uh...
6,Caitlyn,apothecary,Uh... she's been stabbed.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,She makes potions.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,Helps people here with...
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,...with this.
6,Caitlyn,shimmer addict,Shimmer. Why would you take something that does that to you?
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,I just... wanted to feel what it was like...
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,To be somebody. To make other people afraid.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,Instead of...
6,apothecary,Caitlyn,Trade.
6,Caitlyn,apothecary,"Thank you, I really..."
6,Caitlyn,shimmer addict,Let's go. I think Vi will be happy to see a friendly face.
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,"No, no. You go ahead."
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,She knew me when I was still...
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,"Anyway, I don't want her to see me like this."
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,"Just tell her, uh, tell her I'm sorry. About everything."
6,shimmer addict,Caitlyn,Okay?
6,Marcus,Jayce,I found this on one of the Firelights.
6,Marcus,Jayce,It matches fragments we found outside your lab and at the Hexgates.
6,Marcus,Jayce,I... have reason to believe they're planning more attacks.
6,Jayce,Marcus,"Well, how has this threat gone unnoticed for so long?"
6,Marcus,Jayce,"Since the Hexgates were completed, the fissures haven't been a priority."
6,Jayce,Marcus,"Oh, we'll settle that later. For now, we need to prevent any further attacks."
6,Marcus,Jayce,Short of searching everyone who crosses the bridges.
6,Marcus,Jayce,I don't know how we can.
6,Jayce,Marcus,"Then, that's what we'll do."
6,Marcus,Jayce,Are you certain? This sort of an order...
6,Jayce,Marcus,Do it. We have to protect the city.
6,Marcus,Jayce,One other thing.
6,Marcus,Jayce,I saw Caitlyn Kiramman had a prisoner released on your order.
6,Marcus,Jayce,Is there anything I can assist with?
6,Jayce,Marcus,"No. No, uh, we've got it covered."
6,Heimerdinger,,"Councilors, we have lost our way."
6,Heimerdinger,,This city was founded to be a bastion of enlightenment.
6,Heimerdinger,,In a world that cannibalized itself over power and pride.
6,Heimerdinger,,But we've forgotten.
6,Heimerdinger,,Loosened our morals in favor of comfort and convenience.
6,Heimerdinger,,Traded honor for prestige.
6,Heimerdinger,,We were once one tribe.
6,Heimerdinger,,Now we are Houses divided.
6,Heimerdinger,,"I believe, if we set aside our greed and arrogance, we can be one again."
6,Heimerdinger,,It will take vigilance. We must hold each other accountable.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,And who holds you accountable?
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,What?
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,Shimmer is rampant in the undercity.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,Attacks at the Hexgates and in the Academy Square.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,Enforcers fear to set foot in the Lanes. All under your watch.
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Jayce, you forget yourself."
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"I'm sorry, Professor,"
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,but healing this city will take more than just speeches.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"Time and again, you've warned us what not to do."
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"But let me ask you this, what's your plan to fix this?"
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,I see what this is about.
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,Your Hextech projects need more time. More safeguards.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,Humans don't live for centuries. We can't wait for progress.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"We need a leadership focused on the future, not the past."
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,"You are the true Father of Piltover,"
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,and your years of service can never be repaid.
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,I believe it's time we gave the beloved founder of our city...
6,Jayce,Heimerdinger,a well-deserved retirement.
6,Heimerdinger,Jayce,"Jayce, don't do this."
6,,,Hmm.
6,Jayce,,It has to be unanimous. All in favor?
6,Mel,Heimerdinger,"With my deepest respect and appreciation, Professor."
6,Caitlyn,Vi,Vi.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,"Easy, easy, easy."
6,Caitlyn,Vi,We need you back on your feet.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,What was the name Sevika gave you? Jinx?
6,Vi,Caitlyn,Right. Jinx. How could I forget?
6,Caitlyn,Vi,We're going to have to be more careful now.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,Silco will be watching...
6,Caitlyn,Vi,You used to live here?
6,Caitlyn,Vi,Who's Powder?
6,Vi,Caitlyn,"My sister. I thought she died, but, no."
6,Vi,Caitlyn,I have to try and find her.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,How do you not know if your sister is alive or dead?
6,Vi,Caitlyn,It's hard to check up on people from inside a concrete cell.
6,Caitlyn,Vi,"What, you don't have parents?"
6,Vi,Caitlyn,No! They were killed by enforcers.
6,Silco,Vi,Vander's prodigy.
6,Silco,Vi,I've regretted that we never had the opportunity to speak.
6,Vi,Silco,What have you done with my sister?
6,Silco,Vi,I've freed her.
6,Silco,Vi,"Candidly, I thought you were the prize of your secondhand family."
6,Silco,Vi,But Jinx...
6,Silco,Vi,Oh. She is more than I ever imagined.
6,Vi,Silco,I'm gonna find her and erase whatever fucked-up delusions you put in her head.
6,Vi,Silco,"But first, I'm gonna bring your bullshit empire down all around you."
6,Silco,Vi,"You don't know your limits, girl. It's what got Vander killed."
6,Silco,Vi,What drove your sister away. And it's why I'm here right now.
6,Vi,Silco,"Yeah, well..."
6,Vi,Silco,You talk too much.
6,Singed,Viktor,Rio will live.
6,Viktor,Singed,You did this?
6,Singed,Viktor,I thought you understood. The mutation must survive.
6,Viktor,Singed,I understand now.
6,Silco,,How many problems can one girl cause?
6,Vi,Jinx,Powder?
6,Jinx,Vi,Vi?
6,Vi,Jinx,"Oh, Powder!"
6,Vi,Jinx,"I'm so sorry, Powder. I..."
6,Vi,Jinx,"I tried to come back. I promise, I did. But I... I got arrested."
6,Jinx,Vi,Marcus?
6,Vi,Jinx,I don't know. I... It doesn't matter.
6,Vi,Jinx,I just... I never thought I'd see you again.
6,Jinx,Vi,Are you real?
6,Vi,Jinx,"Yes, of course. It's me, Vi, your sister."
6,Vi,Jinx,I'm here. I'm right here.
6,Jinx,Vi,Things changed when you left. I changed.
6,Vi,Jinx,"I know, Pow-pow, I know. You did what you had to do to survive."
6,Vi,Jinx,Me too. It's okay.
6,Vi,Jinx,What matters is we're together.
6,Jinx,Vi,Who's she?
6,Caitlyn,Jinx,Who are you?
6,Vi,Jinx,It's okay. She's a friend.
6,Jinx,Vi,Sevika wasn't lying? You're with an enforcer?
6,Caitlyn,Vi,Your sister is Jinx?
6,Vi,Caitlyn,"Caitlyn, just listen, we can work this out."
6,Jinx,Vi,This is a trick! You're playing me!
6,Jinx,Jinx,Shut up! I'm in no mood.
6,Caitlyn,Jinx,We didn't say anything.
6,Jinx,Caitlyn,I wasn't talking to you!
6,Vi,Jinx,"Powder, it's okay."
6,Jinx,Vi,Stop calling me that.
6,Jinx,Vi,It's Jinx now. Powder fell down a well.
6,Vi,Jinx,You're not a jinx.
6,Vi,Jinx,"God, I never should have..."
6,Jinx,Vi,Stop talking to me like I'm a child!
6,Jinx,Vi,Was that why you came?
6,Jinx,Vi,For this stupid stone?
6,Vi,Jinx,"No, I don't even know what that is, I..."
6,Jinx,Vi,"You're a class act, Sister."
6,Jinx,Vi,Sister. Thought I missed her. Bet you wouldn't miss her.
6,Vi,Jinx,Powder! I'm here for you. Only you.
6,Vi,Jinx,"You can fire that thing if you want, but I'm not going anywhere."
6,Vi,Jinx,I'm not going to abandon you again.
6,Jinx,Jinx,"Everyone, shut up, I need to think."
6,Jinx,Vi,Do you hear that?
6,Vi,Jinx,Powder.
6,Vi,Jinx,Powder!
6,Ekko,Firefly 1,Take her.
6,Powder,,Vi?
6,Powder,,No!
,,,
7,Caitlyn,Vi,I knew it was a mistake trusting you.
7,Vi,Caitlyn,You've been a real picnic yourself.
7,Caitlyn,Vi,"I'm not the one who walked us into, not one, but two of Silco's traps."
7,Vi,Caitlyn,"This isn't Silco, it's someone else."
7,Caitlyn,Vi,How do you know?
7,Vi,Caitlyn,Cause we'd already be dead.
7,Caitlyn,Vi,"Oh, very nice."
7,Caitlyn,Vi,When were you planning to tell me that your lunatic sister works for him?
7,Vi,Caitlyn,Just as soon as you came clean about what the hell you're really doing down here.
7,Caitlyn,Vi,I told you the truth.
7,Vi,Caitlyn,Bullshit.
7,Vi,Caitlyn,What was that glowing stone?
7,Vi,Caitlyn,That's what I thought.
7,Caitlyn,Vi,What's going on?
7,Vi,guard,"Hey, stop! Get your hands off of me!"
7,Caitlyn,guard,Leave her alone!
7,Vi,guard,Let me go!
7,Caitlyn,guard,Vi?
7,Caitlyn,guard,Vi!
7,Caitlyn,guard,Vi!
7,Vi,guard,Hey.
7,Vi,Ekko,You shy? Or just ugly?
7,Ekko,Vi,You look good for a dead girl.
7,Vi,Ekko,Ekko?
7,Ekko,Vi,What do you know about this?
7,Vi,Ekko,Nothing. What the hell is this all about?
7,Ekko,Vi,What were you doing with Jinx?
7,Vi,Ekko,Her name is Powder.
7,Vi,Ekko,And I just found her when you and your goons showed up.
7,Vi,Ekko,It's me. Vi.
7,Vi,Ekko,Same person who used to take you down to the junk heap and hose you down when you got covered in grease.
7,Ekko,Vi,That was a long time ago.
7,Ekko,Vi,People change.
7,Vi,Ekko,Yeah. I'm getting that.
7,Ekko,Vi,Are you working for Silco?
7,Vi,Ekko,Fuck. You.
7,Ekko,Vi,I thought you were dead.
7,Ekko,Vi,Now you show up with a Piltie and give her a tour of the Lanes?
7,Vi,Ekko,You were following us? Why didn't you say something?
7,Ekko,Vi,I didn't know if I could trust you.
7,Vi,Ekko,So... so you just come out swinging?
7,Ekko,Vi,"Gee, I wonder who I learned that from?"
7,Vi,Ekko,"Ah, well, you shoulda learned more. You still punch like a little boy."
7,Ekko,Vi,And you still block with your face.
7,Vi,Ekko,I remember when you wouldn't stand up to me.
7,Vi,Ekko,"I missed you, little man."
7,Ekko,Vi,How long have you had those off?
7,Vi,Ekko,How long have you been whining?
7,Singed,Viktor,Hmm. Fascinating.
7,Singed,Viktor,I would very much like to see the device.
7,Singed,Viktor,"This, uh, Hexcore."
7,Viktor,Singed,That may be difficult to arrange.
7,Viktor,Singed,"I've tried every combination of runes, but... it's always the same."
7,Viktor,Singed,"The subject, wither and rot."
7,Singed,Viktor,"Uh, perhaps the error resides not with your calculations but... with your subjects."
7,Singed,Viktor,"Nature has made us intolerant to change, but fortunately, we have the capacity to change our nature."
7,Viktor,Singed,And this is... Shimmer?
7,Singed,Viktor,A variant.
7,Singed,Viktor,It should provide everything one needs to survive a violent transition.
7,Viktor,Singed,Will it work on plants?
7,Singed,Viktor,"You aren't here about the plants, are you?"
7,Singed,Viktor,I know the look of a doomed man.
7,Singed,Viktor,I must warn you.
7,Singed,Viktor,"If you take this path, they will despise you."
7,Singed,Viktor,Love and legacy are the sacrifices we make for progress.
7,Singed,Viktor,It's why I parted ways with Heimerdinger.
7,Viktor,Singed,Jayce will understand.
7,Singed,Viktor,Perhaps.
7,Mel,Jayce,Hammer work is such a delicate art.
7,Jayce,Mel,How'd you find me?
7,Mel,Jayce,You're the de facto head of the Council. People notice where you go.
7,Jayce,Mel,Huh. Don't remind me.
7,Mel,Jayce,This border shutdown has people agitated.
7,Jayce,Mel,They should be.
7,Jayce,Mel,Marcus brought this to me. It's an explosive.
7,Jayce,Mel,I tried taking it apart and it nearly killed me.
7,Jayce,Mel,Whoever built it knows exactly what they're doing.
7,Jayce,Mel,This and Shimmer. It's hard to believe what they're capable of.
7,Mel,Jayce,Is that what's really bothering you?
7,Jayce,Mel,"He was my mentor, Mel. And I betrayed him."
7,Mel,Jayce,Everything you said about him was true.
7,Mel,Jayce,"My family cast me out and yet, part of me still loves them."
7,Mel,Jayce,Heimerdinger will understand eventually.
7,Mel,Jayce,"It's your time now, Jayce. No more red tape."
7,Mel,Jayce,"You can bring Hextech to the masses, just like you've always dreamed."
7,Jayce,Mel,"Hmm. First, I have to save Viktor."
7,Mel,Jayce,Where is he?
7,Jayce,Mel,I don't know.
7,Jayce,Mel,He disappeared. He does that sometimes.
7,Jayce,Mel,No sign of Caitlyn either.
7,Mel,Jayce,The Kiramman girl?
7,Jayce,Mel,It's just...
7,Jayce,Mel,"Uh, never mind."
7,Mel,Jayce,Hey. We'll get through this.
7,Mel,Jayce,I'll stall the Council but they'll soon need their leader.
7,Mel,Jayce,In the meantime...
7,Mel,Jayce,Try not to lose your nuts.
7,Sevika,Silco,All our business is down. Enforcers are searching anyone who crosses the bridge.
7,Silco,Sevika,Marcus is following my orders. Preventing Vi and Caitlyn from returning.
7,Sevika,Silco,Or he's finally flipped.
7,Silco,Sevika,Hmm.
7,Sevika,Silco,The chembarons scheduled an assembly.
7,Silco,Sevika,Oh.
7,Silco,Sevika,I've had enough headaches.
7,Sevika,Silco,It didn't sound like a request.
7,Sevika,Silco,Where are you going?
7,Silco,Sevika,I need to find Jinx.
7,Sevika,Silco,Sir.
7,Silco,Sevika,What?
7,Sevika,Silco,I got more in common with cave lice than Jinx.
7,Sevika,Silco,But let's just say I didn't always see eye-to-eye with my old man.
7,Silco,Sevika,And?
7,Sevika,Silco,She'll come to you when she's ready.
7,Silco,Sevika,Hmm.
7,Jinx,Mylo,I didn't lose her! They took her.
7,Jinx,Mylo,She was there for me! Not the enforcer.
7,Jinx,Mylo,Why would I remember her name?
7,Jinx,Mylo,"Well, she's just some stupid topsider!"
7,Jinx,Mylo,Caitlyn.
7,Jinx,Mylo,Pow.
7,kid1,kid2,Come on. Go!
7,kid2,kid1,I got it.
7,kid1,kid2,Whoo-hoo!
7,Vi,Ekko,Is that real tree?
7,Ekko,Vi,"Pretty cool, huh?"
7,Ekko,Vi,"When I first saw it, I knew this was the place."
7,Ekko,Vi,"If a single seed could make it down here, so could we."
7,Vi,Ekko,You built all this?
7,Ekko,Vi,Not alone.
7,Ekko,Vi,"After Vander...died, Silco flooded the lanes with Shimmer."
7,Ekko,Vi,He didn't care what it did to people.
7,Ekko,Vi,Everyone here was an addict or a victim.
7,kid1,Ekko,Hi.
7,Ekko,Vi,They needed somewhere safe to start again.
7,Vi,Ekko,I should have been there. For you. For everyone.
7,Ekko,Vi,That's a good way to drive yourself crazy.
7,Ekko,Vi,"If I just went with you that day, maybe none of this would have happened."
7,Vi,Ekko,Or maybe you'd be dead. Or... changed.
7,Ekko,Vi,"Powder's gone, Vi."
7,Ekko,Vi,All that's left is Jinx and she belongs to Silco.
7,Vi,Ekko,You're wrong. She's still in there. I can reach her.
7,Ekko,Vi,You can't.
7,Vi,Ekko,I know my sister.
7,Ekko,Vi,I got one more thing to show you.
7,Ekko,Vi,This is everyone we've lost.
7,Ekko,Vi,The price of our freedom.
7,Ekko,Vi,Some of it was Enforcers.
7,Ekko,Vi,Most was Silco.
7,Ekko,Vi,"Your sister works for him not because she has to, but because she wants to."
7,Ekko,Vi,"I'm sorry, but that's who she is now."
7,,,Get down!
7,,,Let us through!
7,,,Come on!
7,,,We understand.
7,,,Just stand down!
7,Jayce,Marcus,"Thank you for alerting me, Sheriff."
7,Marcus,Jayce,"Not a problem, Councilor."
7,Viktor,Jayce,"Jayce, what is this?"
7,Jayce,Viktor,Do you have any idea how this looks?
7,Jayce,Viktor,I order a blockade and my own partner violates it?
7,Viktor,Jayce,You ordered this? Why?
7,Jayce,Viktor,There are people down there who seem hell-bent on destroying us.
7,Jayce,Viktor,What were you doing?
7,Viktor,Jayce,I was consulting a friend about our quandary.
7,Viktor,Jayce,"I told you, I knew someone."
7,Jayce,Viktor,"Well, you didn't say they were from the undercity."
7,Viktor,Jayce,What difference does that make?
7,Jayce,Viktor,What diff... They're dangerous.
7,Viktor,Jayce,I'm from the undercity.
7,Jayce,Viktor,You're right.
7,Jayce,Viktor,I'm sorry.
7,Jayce,Viktor,I've had a lot on my plate.
7,Jayce,Viktor,Was your friend able to help?
7,Viktor,Jayce,No.
7,Viktor,Jayce,"No, he said, ""Nature was resistant to this sort of tampering."""
7,Jayce,Viktor,"All right, we'll keep at it."
7,Finn,,"First, this wild attack in the heart of Piltover."
7,Finn,,"Now, the border's closing."
7,Finn,,We're bleeding money and for what?
7,Finn,,His dreams of rebellion? He's losing control.
7,Finn,,If we stand together...
7,Silco,Finn,We aren't due for an assembly.
7,Finn,Silco,We should be.
7,Finn,Silco,"Ever since your stunt topside, profits have been plummeting."
7,,Silco,He's right. Merchandise is frozen at the border.
7,,Silco,Topsiders are too afraid to cross.
7,Finn,Silco,"We're all wondering, what's your plan to fix this?"
7,Silco,,"You're all wondering, are you?"
7,Finn,Silco,"Way I see it, we should cut a deal and give back the Gemstone."
7,Finn,Silco,Better to have some trade than none at all.
7,Silco,Finn,The border issue is temporary. Jinx will deal with it.
7,Finn,Silco,Huh.
7,Finn,Silco,"Rumor is, your dog's off her leash."
7,Finn,Silco,"How you meant to bring Piltover to heel if you can't handle your own people, huh?"
7,,,What's that?
7,Silco,,"Oh, you don't recognize it?"
7,Silco,,Have you forgotten where we came from?
7,Silco,,The mines they had us in?
7,Silco,,Air so thick it clogged your throat.
7,Silco,,Stuck in your eyes.
7,Silco,,But I pulled you all up from the depths.
7,Silco,,Offered you a taste of topside.
7,Silco,,And fresh air.
7,Silco,,I gave you life.
7,Silco,,Purpose.
7,Silco,,But you've grown fat and complacent.
7,Silco,,Too much time in the sun.
7,Silco,Finn,"We came from a world where there was never enough to go around, Finn."
7,Silco,,That is why we fight.
7,Silco,,Do you remember?
7,Finn,Silco,Sorry. Please.
7,Finn,Silco,Please.
7,Silco,Finn,Don't forget again.
7,Silco,,Good meeting.
7,Elora,Mel,I've had word from our friends overseas.
7,Elora,Mel,This threat from the undercity is drawing attention.
7,Elora,Mel,Piltover looks vulnerable.
7,Mel,Elora,It's too soon. Jayce isn't ready.
7,Elora,Mel,There's one other thing.
7,Elora,Mel,This arrived for you.
7,kid,Caitlyn,Hmm?
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,What have you done with Vi?
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,"Listen, let her go. I brought her here. It's me you want."
7,Vi,Caitlyn,My hero.
7,Caitlyn,Vi,You're...
7,Caitlyn,Vi,But I thought you... I thought they were hurting you!
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,Vi tells me I can trust you.
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,"You get a pass back topside, that's it."
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,Let's go.
7,Jinx,Silco,Let me help you with that.
7,Silco,Jinx,"Where've you been, Jinx?"
7,Jinx,Silco,"Oh, you know. Here, there, chasing down dead ends."
7,Jinx,Silco,And guess what? They're not all dead.
7,Silco,Jinx,I can explain.
7,Jinx,Silco,"Don't move, silly. I might hurt you."
7,Silco,Jinx,I didn't know. Marcus never told me she was in Stillwater.
7,Jinx,Silco,But you found out she came back.
7,Jinx,Silco,You lied.
7,Silco,Jinx,I wanted to protect you.
7,Jinx,Silco,From what?
7,Silco,Jinx,She and the enforcer are back for the crystal. Not for you.
7,Silco,Jinx,Have you forgotten how she left you?
7,Silco,Jinx,Who found you? Who cared for you? Gave you a home?
7,Silco,Jinx,I am your family. Everyone else betrays us.
7,Silco,Jinx,I need you.
7,Silco,Jinx,Now more than ever.
7,Silco,Jinx,You have to complete the weapon.
7,Caitlyn,Vi,It's beautiful.
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,"If your people had your way, it'd be rubble and ash."
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,It's a misunderstanding.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,They think you work for Silco.
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,Your people hunt us like animals. Silco pays them to do it.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,That's not possible. You're wrong.
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,Say that one more time.
7,Vi,Ekko,"Ekko, she believes what she's saying, okay? She's not your enemy."
7,Ekko,Vi,"Oh, yeah? Then what's this?"
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,You got it. You have to let me take that back.
7,Vi,Caitlyn,What is it?
7,Caitlyn,Vi,It's a Gemstone.
7,Caitlyn,Vi,It was stolen during the attack. By your sister.
7,Vi,Caitlyn,You just forgot to mention that?
7,Caitlyn,Vi,"With this, someone with the right knowledge could build any Hextech device."
7,Caitlyn,Vi,"If enforcers are becoming more... aggressive, that's why."
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,We could beat Silco with this.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,That won't solve things.
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,Easy for you to say. Your people aren't dying all around you.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,"Ekko, it's wrong what's been done to you."
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,You'd be well within your rights to keep it.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,I couldn't blame you.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,"But... if you do, this cycle of violence will never stop."
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,This is our best shot at setting the record straight.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,This city needs healing.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,More than I ever realized.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,"Please, let me help you."
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,You got a plan?
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,I have a friend on the council.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,Let me take the Gemstone to him.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,He'll listen to me. Your people wouldn't have to hide anymore.
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,One condition. I'm the one who gives it to them.
7,Viktor,Jayce,"Um, the form is crude, but uh, the engineering is... inspired."
7,Jayce,Viktor,You think they could crack Hextech?
7,Viktor,Jayce,Mm. It's a leap.
7,Mel,Jayce,It's been suggested that they may have found a way to utilize the Gemstone.
7,Mel,Jayce,"If we are to assume the worst, that would mean they've turned it into a weapon."
7,Jayce,Mel,"Well, do we know this for certain?"
7,Mel,Jayce,We can't afford to wait to find out.
7,Viktor,Mel,Wait. What are you suggesting?
7,Mel,Jayce,We should prepare our own countermeasures.
7,Jayce,Mel,You want us to build weapons?
7,Viktor,Mel,Absolutely not. That is not why we invented Hextech.
7,Jayce,Mel,We would shatter any attempt at peace.
7,Jayce,Mel,Heimerdinger would never go for this.
7,Mel,Jayce,Heimerdingers' inaction is what brought us here. You said so yourself.
7,Mel,Jayce,"The peace is already broken, Jayce."
7,Mel,Jayce,I'm only asking you to prepare to defend your people.
7,Mel,Jayce,"If we're lucky, we'll never need to use it."
7,Mel,Jayce,The decision is yours.
7,Viktor,Jayce,Ridiculous. You cannot be considering this.
7,Jayce,Viktor,What if she's right? Are we just gonna stand by while they attack us?
7,Viktor,Jayce,"We're scientists, not soldiers."
7,Jayce,Viktor,We have the knowledge to defend ourselves.
7,Viktor,Jayce,"We agreed Hextech was to improve lives, not to take them."
7,Jayce,Viktor,We may not have a choice.
7,Viktor,Jayce,There is always a choice.
7,Jayce,Viktor,I need to think.
7,Caitlyn,Vi,What are they?
7,Vi,Caitlyn,We call them firelights. Never seen so many though.
7,Jayce,Talis,I'm worried I have to do something I never thought I would.
7,Ekko,Vi,Vi?
7,Vi,Ekko,I can't leave her again.
7,Ekko,Vi,You can't change her.
7,Vi,Ekko,I have to try.
7,Ekko,Vi,Don't get yourself killed.
7,Vi,Ekko,No promises.
7,Vi,Caitlyn,"It's been real, Cupcake. Thanks. For everything."
7,Jinx,Mylo,Shut up. It's just a goodbye hug.
7,Jinx,Mylo,She wouldn't do that. Not again.
7,Marcus,Caitlyn,Halt!
7,Marcus,Caitlyn,What the hell is this?
7,Caitlyn,Marcus,Sir! I have proof. Silco's behind everything.
7,Marcus,Caitlyn,Show me.
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,No.
7,Caitlyn,Ekko,Hmm.
7,Ekko,Caitlyn,Shit.
7,Vi,Caitlyn,Caitlyn!
7,Jinx,Vi,Liar.
7,Marcus,Caitlyn,I told you to leave this alone.
7,Marcus,Caitlyn,Tell my...
7,Marcus,Caitlyn,Tell my daughter I...
7,Ekko,Vi,Go!
7,Jinx,Ekko,"Oh, look who it is. The boy savior."
7,Jinx,Ekko,Hah.
7,Jinx,Ekko,Yes!
7,Jinx,Ekko,No.

8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"When I was ten, your grandfather brought me to the aftermath"
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,He offered me a gold coin for every blade I retrieved from the fallen.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Said we needed the steel.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,But I knew it was a lie.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,He wanted me to know death.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Kino says war is a failure of statecraft.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Your brother thinks he can talk his way out of anything.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,He fancies himself a fox among the wolves.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"But mark me, child, if you want to last in this world,"
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,you must learn to be both the fox and the wolf.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,We'll paint the walls in gold.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Import crystal chandeliers.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,"Advisors will enter here,"
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,"but the regent will have her own, secret entrance."
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,"She should have a kind, fat face."
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,"Clever, to charm her subjects, but pliable so we can mold her."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"Perhaps, she could be my daughter."
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,You'd give me a throne?
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"I will give you the world, child, if you prove you can take it."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,What should we do with her?
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,She won't make trouble for us.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Strip her of her possessions and send her to the far colonies.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,She's a symbol of the old regime.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"Kill her now, and only one must die."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Let her live and you may need to kill thousands.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,We can show the people we are merciful.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,A wolf has no mercy.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,Will you be okay?
8,Vi,Caitlyn,I'll be right back.
8,Caitlyn,Vi,Okay.
8,Silco,,Jinx!
8,Caitlyn,Vi,It's gone.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,What?
8,Caitlyn,Vi,It was all for nothing.
8,sergeant,Jayce,"Sir, we've secured the area."
8,sergeant,Jayce,I've got orders to escort you back into the city.
8,sergeant,Jayce,Sir?
8,sergeant,Jayce,Are you all right?
8,Vi,Caitlyn,Who lives here? Another Councilor friend of yours?
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,Caitlyn!
8,Mr. Kiramman,Caitlyn,Oh. We were so worried. Thank goodness you're safe!
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,And you found a stray.
8,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramman,This is Vi.
8,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramman,She's from the undercity.
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,So I see.
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,"Could we have a word, Caitlyn?"
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,In private.
8,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramman,You have to speak to the Council.
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,Speak to the Council?
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,You understand you've broken several laws?
8,Mr. Kiramman,Mrs. Kiramman,She was doing what she thought was right.
8,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramman,I'll take responsibility.
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,You're a Councilor's daughter.
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,Your actions reflect on the entire body.
8,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramman,My actions?
8,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramman,You know what else reflects on the Council?
8,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramman,Its citizens living on the streets. Being poisoned.
8,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramman,Having to choose between a kingpin who wants to exploit them and a government that doesn't give a shit.
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,Caitlyn!
8,Mr. Kiramman,Mrs. Kiramman,I'm sure our daughter could use some rest after her adventures.
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,I'll schedule an audience.
8,Caitlyn,Mrs. Kiramman,Thank you.
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,You and your friend can address the Council yourselves.
8,Mrs. Kiramman,Caitlyn,I'd suggest you prepare accordingly.
8,Singed,Silco,Her injuries are severe.
8,Silco,Singed,You think I can't see that?
8,Singed,Silco,Huh.
8,Singed,Silco,"I believe I can save her, but the process will be demanding."
8,Singed,Silco,Sometimes death is a mercy.
8,Silco,Singed,She can take it.
8,Singed,Silco,"And before I begin, I must know..."
8,Singed,Silco,Are you prepared to lose her?
8,Silco,Singed,Jinx?
8,Silco,Singed,Jinx!
8,Silco,Singed,"She won't die, Doctor."
8,Silco,Singed,She can't.
8,Singed,Silco,I understand.
8,Singed,Silco,"Please understand, this is for your own sanity."
8,Singed,Silco,"I, too, once had a daughter."
8,Sevika,Finn,Silco isn't taking guests.
8,Finn,Sevika,Not a problem.
8,Finn,Sevika,Wasn't here for him. Thought I might bend your ear.
8,Finn,Sevika,"You know when I ask my mates what Silco's up to, your name's first out of their mouths."
8,Finn,Sevika,"Sevika's out in the harbor, or ""Sevika paid the knuckleheads a visit."""
8,Finn,Sevika,You're a scary lady.
8,Sevika,Finn,Get to your point.
8,Finn,Sevika,"Run a tight ship, don't you?"
8,Finn,Sevika,Except it's not your ship.
8,Finn,Sevika,It's his and Jinx's.
8,Sevika,Finn,This is your plan?
8,Sevika,Finn,Undermine Silco by making a half-assed play at my ego?
8,Sevika,Finn,"Gotta hand it to you, Finn."
8,Sevika,Finn,"Every time I think you can't get dumber, you dig a new low."
8,Finn,Sevika,"Let's be plain, then. He's slipping."
8,Finn,Sevika,The undercity's devolving to chaos.
8,Finn,Sevika,"And somehow, I get the feeling he isn't up there balancing booksheets."
8,Finn,Sevika,"Jinx gets a whim, suddenly his spine's made of jelly."
8,Finn,Sevika,"And here you are, shoveling his shit."
8,Finn,Sevika,"Ego is one thing, brain's another."
8,Finn,Sevika,You aren't the only one dissatisfied with his performance.
8,Finn,Sevika,There's bigger fish than Silco.
8,Mrs. Medarda,,Mel. Elora. You didn't have to come out to meet me.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,"What are you doing here, Mother?"
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Can I not visit?
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,I've heard stories of Piltover's hospitality.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,You didn't sail halfway across the continent to sample the local cuisine.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"It's been over a decade, Mel."
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Since you banished me?
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Such drama.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,I sent you here to oversee our family's interests and grow yourself.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Which you have.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,"You said, ""Perhaps, your sentimentality will be more at home"
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,"with those soft-spined idealists overseas."""
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,You have your father's memory.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Don't try to ingratiate yourself with me.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Mel.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Or that.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Your brother's gone.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,What happened?
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,He crossed the wrong man.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,I was distracted.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,That's a mistake I can't take back.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Your Jayce Talis has turned his eye to Hextech weaponry.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,I knew it.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,War is coming.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,You've let the problems of your undercity fester too long.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Piltover isn't like Noxus.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,War isn't our first and every recourse.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,"I sponsored Hextech to protect the city, not burn it to the ground."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"It's not conjecture, it's a fact."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Weapons can't be unmade and they are always used.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,I'm here to help guide you to the right decisions.
8,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,I don't need your guidance.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,We'll see.
8,boy,Mrs. Medarda,Miss Medarda?
8,Mel,,Yes?
8,Mrs. Medarda,,Yes?
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"He's for me, dear."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,I'm off to sample the local cuisine.
8,Caitlyn,Vi,We'll present our case to the Council tonight.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,You did all this yourself?
8,Vi,Caitlyn,Without even going down there?
8,Vi,Caitlyn,And I thought Powder could get obsessed.
8,Caitlyn,Vi,"What happened to her, it's not your fault."
8,Vi,Caitlyn,When my parents were still alive...
8,Vi,Caitlyn,me and Powder used to share a bed like this.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,"Except, maybe, half the size."
8,Vi,Caitlyn,We played a game where we pretended to be bigger and bigger monsters.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,"So she would say, ""I'm a slug monster with venom for ooze."""
8,Vi,Caitlyn,"And I'd say, ""Well, I'm a slug-eating crab with razor spikes."""
8,Vi,Caitlyn,"Sometimes, I... I'd get carried away and she'd get scared."
8,Vi,Caitlyn,"I didn't want her to start crying and wake my parents up, so..."
8,Vi,Caitlyn,I pretended to chase my own monsters away.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,I'd say...
8,Vi,Caitlyn,No monster's gonna get you when I'm here.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,Then a real monster showed up.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,And I just ran away.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,I left her.
8,Vi,Jinx,"You know, Powder, you're stronger than you think."
8,Jinx,,Vi?
8,Jinx,,No!
8,Jinx,,"No, no. No!"
8,Singed,Jinx,I understand this must be painful.
8,Jinx,,No!
8,Singed,Jinx,I'm afraid it will only get worse.
8,Jinx,,Wait!
8,Jinx,,No!
8,Silco,Singed,What have you done?
8,Singed,Silco,I saved her life.
8,,,"Hey, watch it, furball."
8,,,Move.
8,Heimerdinger,,Oh.
8,,,Hmm.
8,Heimerdinger,,Hmm.
8,Heimerdinger,,Huh?
8,,,Hmm...
8,Heimerdinger,,Like this.
8,,,Get away from her.
8,,,Bye...
8,Heimerdinger,,"Oh, ingenious."
8,Heimerdinger,,Though these blades seem improperly pitched.
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,You're wrong.
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,It's designed for the fissures.
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,The air is denser.
8,Heimerdinger,Ekko,Oh.
8,Heimerdinger,Ekko,"Are you all right, lad?"
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,"Yeah, I'm fine, I just sprained my ankle."
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,Are you Councilor Heimerdinger?
8,Heimerdinger,Ekko,It's just Heimerdinger now.
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,What are you doing on this side of the river?
8,Heimerdinger,Ekko,I wanted to offer my assistance
8,Heimerdinger,Ekko,"to the citizens of the undercity, but..."
8,Heimerdinger,Ekko,it seems I'm unwelcome.
8,Heimerdinger,Ekko,What is it?
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,We're having the exact same day.
8,Heimerdinger,Ekko,That looks like more than a sprain. You need medical attention.
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,I have to get home. It isn't safe for me here.
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,"I don't know how I'm gonna get there with my leg busted, and, well..."
8,Ekko,Heimerdinger,you're holding my ride.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,"Do they teach military history at your Academy, Mr. Talis?"
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,"It's, um, Councilor Talis."
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,And I'm not sure.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,The Alornian General Sonnem Parlec
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,used to find ways to meet his enemies blindfolded.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,He said a man's mind hides behind his body.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,"Somehow, I doubt he ever tried this."
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,You're Mel's mom.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,Among other things.
8,Mrs. Medarda,,"Squeeze, child. You won't break it."
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,"I do have other matters, so if you'll excuse me..."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,The threat of the undercity is real.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,Your leadership is impotent.
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,"We may not be Noxus, but Piltover isn't as helpless as you think."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,Who said anything about Piltover?
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,The Council is the problem. The mind hiding behind the body.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,Navigating your current crisis requires expertise you lack.
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,Do you know what the success rate for senior Academy inventors is?
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,Three percent.
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,We're no strangers to failure.
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,What makes this the City of Progress is that we keep trying until we get it right.
8,Jayce,Mrs. Medarda,"So thank you for your advice, Mrs. Medarda, but I have a city to run."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,Wait.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,I see why this province and my daughter have fallen for you.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,You have the passion of youth.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,I have experience.
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,"I want you to succeed here, Jayce, to grace the world with Hextech."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,"But if you don't accept certain realities, I fear you'll end up like General Parlec."
8,Mrs. Medarda,Jayce,Slaughtered with your eyes closed.
8,,,Three of my suppliers have said
8,,,they intend to delay shipments until fall
8,,,"to give things ""time to cool off."""
8,Mrs. Kiramann,,We have greater concerns than a dip in profits.
8,Mrs. Kiramann,,The Sheriff betrayed us. We need better information.
8,Jayce,,We need to act. Before anyone else gets killed.
8,,,Perhaps Marcus was operating independently.
8,,,What could anyone in the undercity offer him that he didn't have up here?
8,Caitlyn,,"It's not what they offered him,"
8,Caitlyn,,it's what he had to lose.
8,Mrs. Kiramann,,"Councilors, my daughter has a unique insight into our situation."
8,Caitlyn,,Thank you.
8,Caitlyn,,"Councilors, this is Vi. She was born in the undercity."
8,Caitlyn,,"Even though we failed her in countless ways,"
8,Caitlyn,,she risked everything to show me what life is really like down there.
8,Caitlyn,,"People are starving, sick, ravaged by Shimmer."
8,Caitlyn,,They live in constant fear
8,Caitlyn,,of the coordinated efforts of violent crime lords.
8,Caitlyn,,One man leads these efforts.
8,Caitlyn,,Silco.
8,,,We've done investigations of Silco.
8,,,They yielded no such level of organization.
8,Caitlyn,,And who led these investigations?
8,Jayce,,What does this Silco even want from us?
8,Caitlyn,,He believes the undercity should be independent.
8,Caitlyn,,He calls it the Nation of Zaun.
8,Jayce,,What about these? Do you know who made them?
8,Caitlyn,,"No, well..."
8,Caitlyn,,Uh...
8,Vi,,Her name is Jinx.
8,Jayce,,This Jinx has the Gemstone?
8,Jayce,,Then we have to go in by force.
8,Mel,,That could trigger war.
8,Caitlyn,,There are good people down there.
8,,,Hmph. Bad ones too.
8,,,"Even if we wanted to invade, they have Shimmer."
8,Jayce,,We have Hextech.
8,Caitlyn,,What happened to you?
8,Jayce,,We've been talking about talking for weeks now.
8,Jayce,,They're still cleaning the blood off the bridge.
8,Jayce,,When do we say enough is enough?
8,Mel,,"Jayce, you don't know war."
8,Mel,,I do.
8,Mel,,It must be our last resort. There may be a diplomatic solution.
8,,,She's right.
8,Vi,,What? You want to negotiate with him?
8,Mrs. Kiramann,,It may be the only way to avoid further bloodshed.
8,Vi,,This is insane. Did you learn nothing?
8,Vi,,You can't talk to him!
8,Vi,,He hates you. Everything you stand for.
8,Vi,,He will never back down.
8,,,"Enforcers, please escort them out."
8,Vi,,Forget it.
8,Vi,,I remember where your fancy damn door is.
8,Caitlyn,Vi,Vi! Wait!
8,Caitlyn,Vi,Wait! Where are you going?
8,Vi,Caitlyn,I don't know. Back where I came from?
8,Vi,Caitlyn,Seems like that's what everyone up here wants.
8,Caitlyn,Vi,I can fix this.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,You can't!
8,Vi,Caitlyn,This is how things are. How they've always been.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,I was so stupid to think it could change.
8,Caitlyn,Vi,There must be something else we can do. Some other way.
8,Caitlyn,Vi,We'll make a new plan. We have to try.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,We tried. Okay? It wasn't enough.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,Topside and bottom. Oil and water. That's all there is.
8,Caitlyn,Vi,What about us?
8,Vi,Caitlyn,Oil and water.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,Wasn't meant to be.
8,Caitlyn,Vi,You're just saying that.
8,Vi,Caitlyn,"Do yourself a favor, Cupcake."
8,Vi,Caitlyn,"Go back to that big, shiny house of yours and just..."
8,Vi,Caitlyn,"forget me, okay?"
8,Sky,,"Viktor, I've been working on a private project"
8,Sky,,for a couple weeks now.
8,Sky,,No.
8,Sky,,"Viktor, I've been working on this for a year now and..."
8,Sky,,Viktor.
8,Sky,,"Viktor, I was hoping you might take a look at something I've been working on."
8,Sky,,Viktor...
8,Sky,,I was inspired by your...
8,Sky,,Everything you do inspires me.
8,Sky,Viktor,Viktor!
8,Sky,Viktor,Viktor!
8,Viktor,,Sky? Sky? No.
8,Viktor,,No! That... that can't... that can't...
8,Vi,Jayce,You want to make Silco pay for what he's done?
8,Jayce,Vi,I could have you arrested.
8,Vi,Jayce,You guys really like to bandy that threat around.
8,Vi,Jayce,You ever been to Stillwater?
8,Jayce,Vi,No.
8,Vi,Jayce,"So you just wave an arm, have someone dragged off,"
8,Vi,Jayce,don't bother to find out what it does to someone
8,Vi,Jayce,"being stuffed in a stone box for weeks, or months, or even years?"
8,Jayce,Vi,Yeah. I want to make Silco pay.
8,Vi,Jayce,I want in.
8,Jayce,Vi,There is no in.
8,Jayce,Vi,You heard the Council.
8,Vi,Jayce,Fuck the Council.
8,Vi,Jayce,You said you were tired of doing nothing.
8,Vi,Jayce,That's the only sensible thing that came out of anyone's mouth tonight.
8,Jayce,Vi,I'm not a vigilante.
8,Vi,Jayce,"No, you're a victim."
8,Vi,Jayce,Huh...
8,Vi,Jayce,This so people notice you when you raise your hand in the boardroom?
8,Jayce,Vi,We built them for mining the fissures.
8,Vi,Jayce,Hmm.
8,Vi,Jayce,Someone close to me had a pair of these.
8,Vi,Jayce,You're the first person Caitlyn looked for when we made it to topside.
8,Vi,Jayce,"Of everyone up here,"
8,Vi,Jayce,you're the one she trusted to do something.
8,Jayce,Vi,What do you want me to do? Arrest him?
8,Vi,Jayce,Silco controls the undercity with Shimmer.
8,Vi,Jayce,"Shut down his supply,"
8,Vi,Jayce,and it's only a matter of time before his own people turn on him.
8,Jayce,Vi,And how do we do that?
8,Vi,Jayce,Take out his manufacturing facilities.
8,Vi,Jayce,"Hit them hard and fast, before he can react."
8,Vi,Jayce,So...
8,Vi,Jayce,"We got a deal, pretty boy?"
8,,,Come on.
8,,,Over the bridge.
8,,,Secured!
8,,,Get back!
8,,,You little punk.
8,,,Hey!
8,,,Hmm.
8,,,Hmm.
,,,
9,Vi,Jayce,You didn't have a choice.
9,Vi,Jayce,He knew what he was signing up for.
9,Jayce,Vi,We're done here.
9,Vi,Jayce,We haven't even scratched the surface. Silco's still out there.
9,Jayce,Vi,Do you not understand? I am part of this now!
9,Jayce,Vi,The next parents who get a message their kid isn't coming home...
9,Jayce,Vi,I don't even know where to take it.
9,Jayce,Vi,Do we just leave him here?
9,Vi,Jayce,You've always been a part of this.
9,Vi,Jayce,You just never had to look it in the eye. One dead kid?
9,Vi,Jayce,"There's hundreds more where he came from, thanks to Silco,"
9,Vi,Jayce,and thanks to people like you who stuck their heads in the dirt.
9,Jayce,Vi,This is over.
9,Vi,Jayce,Not for me.
9,Jayce,Vi,Take those off.
9,Vi,Jayce,Make me.
9,Jayce,Vi,I can't let you leave with them.
9,Vi,Jayce,"Then, I guess you're gonna need to kill another trencher."
9,Jayce,Vi,You won't make it alone.
9,Sevika,Silco,Been a while since topside's gotten this bold.
9,Silco,Sevika,Say what you want about the late Sheriff. He had his uses.
9,Sevika,Silco,Too bad Jinx didn't think so.
9,Silco,Sevika,We'll buy another.
9,Renni,Silco,You gonna do anything
9,Renni,Silco,about that piece of shit that murdered my boy?
9,Renni,Silco,"Let me guess, ""Jinx will take care of it."""
9,Renni,Silco,Just like she's been taking care of everything else.
9,Silco,Renni,"We all mourn the loss of your son, Renni."
9,Silco,Renni,"At least, we have the solace of knowing he died fighting for our cause,"
9,Silco,Renni,"instead of some petty personal dispute, as so often occurs here."
9,Renni,Silco,You're one to talk about sacrificing for the cause.
9,Renni,Silco,Where is Jinx anyhow?
9,Silco,Renni,Help her with the body.
9,Sky,,"Viktor, I know this will probably never see the light of day but watching how you work so tirelessly to make"
9,Sky,,"the world a better place... Well, I couldn't forgive myself if I never tried. Everyone's gotta do their part, right?"
9,Mrs. Medarda,,Okay.
9,Mrs. Medarda,,Noxian wine is bold by comparison.
9,Mrs. Medarda,,The grapes are hardened by the climate.
9,Mrs. Medarda,,"But then, so is everything that manages to survive in Noxus."
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"Mel, would you like..."
9,Mel,,Leave.
9,Mrs. Medarda,,Hmm.
9,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Stay away from Jayce!
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,You really are fond of him.
9,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,"Better yet, march back to your ship and get the hell out of my city."
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Get ahold of yourself. I taught you better.
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"We're in trouble, Mel."
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"The man who killed your brother doesn't believe the score is settled,"
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,and his resources exceed ours.
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"If there is a chance Hextech can be weaponized, we must have it."
9,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Piltover isn't your testing ground.
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,I've only accelerated the process you started.
9,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,I wanted to protect the city from people like you.
9,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,I can't believe you'd start a war just to cover your ass.
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,I would set the world ablaze to protect our family.
9,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,No.
9,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,I stopped being part of this family the moment you cast me out.
9,Mel,Mrs. Medarda,Why? Why did you do it?
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Because you weakened me!
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"I couldn't endure the look in your eyes whenever I made the decisions,"
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,the necessary decisions to keep us safe!
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"We need that weapon, Mel."
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,Let the war unfold.
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,"And you come home,"
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,take your place at my side.
9,Mrs. Medarda,Mel,It's where you belong.
9,Viktor,,I'm sorry.
9,Viktor,,I don't know where you'd have preferred.
9,Viktor,,I'm sorry.
9,Jayce,Viktor,Am I interrupting?
9,Jayce,Viktor,Remember the Distinguished Innovators competition?
9,Viktor,Jayce,I remember you notching gears in the carriage over.
9,Jayce,Viktor,They started cranking the engine and the whole thing was rattling.
9,Jayce,Viktor,I thought a loose cog was gonna take someone's eye out.
9,Viktor,Jayce,"At least, you didn't throw up."
9,Jayce,Viktor,Everything made sense then.
9,Viktor,Jayce,You have to destroy it.
9,Jayce,Viktor,I know.
9,Viktor,Jayce,The Hexcore.
9,Viktor,Jayce,I... I can't do it.
9,Viktor,Jayce,You have to. Please.
9,Jayce,Viktor,What about your disease?
9,Jayce,Viktor,Without the Hexcore...
9,Viktor,Jayce,Promise me.
9,Jayce,Viktor,Okay. Okay.
9,Jayce,Viktor,I promise.
9,Viktor,Jayce,We lost ourselves. Lost our dream.
9,Viktor,Jayce,"In the pursuit of great, we failed to do good."
9,Viktor,Jayce,We have to make it right.
9,Silco,,I'm busy.
9,Finn,Silco,"When you took Vander out of play, I thought,"
9,Finn,Silco,Now here's a man who understands what it takes to run an enterprise.
9,Finn,Silco,"The attitude, the instinct, the eye."
9,Finn,Silco,"The whole package, you were."
9,Finn,Silco,Always two steps ahead.
9,Finn,Silco,"But time's lapped you, old man."
9,Silco,Renni,"You're with him, are you?"
9,Renni,Silco,"You screwed up, Silco."
9,Silco,,You're too young to remember what the undercity was
9,Silco,,"before it became an ""enterprise""."
9,Silco,,We had nothing.
9,Silco,,You know what bore us through those times?
9,Silco,,Loyalty.
9,Silco,,Brothers and sisters back-to-back against whatever the world threw at us.
9,Silco,,"Now I'm forced to share the air with parasites like you,"
9,Silco,,who leach off their legacies.
9,Finn,Silco,"Today's the day you die, Silco."
9,Silco,Finn,That's a risk I've known all my life.
9,Silco,Finn,But I still believe in loyalty.
9,Silco,Renni,I would have had your son killed for this.
9,Silco,Renni,Though I suppose we're ahead on that account.
9,Silco,Renni,Get out.
9,Silco,Sevika,Were you tempted?
9,Sevika,Silco,Not for a worm like him.
9,Sevika,Silco,But he won't be the last.
9,Silco,,Hmm.
9,Silco,Jayce,Perfect place for an ambush.
9,Silco,Jayce,And you without your hammer.
9,Jayce,Silco,I was reminded recently of what brought us together in the first place.
9,Jayce,Silco,The threats beyond our walls.
9,Silco,Jayce,This city has a short memory.
9,Jayce,Silco,Progress.
9,Jayce,Silco,Far be it from me to stand in the way.
9,Jayce,Silco,"Free trade routes, blanket amnesty,
unrestricted access to the Hexgates, sovereignty."
9,Jayce,Silco,Do you really think you're in a position to demand all this?
9,Silco,Jayce,"I give you credit for your stunt, boy."
9,Silco,Jayce,Didn't think you had the stomach.
9,Silco,Jayce,"But the big display followed by a request for parley,"
9,Silco,Jayce,you're tipping your hand.
9,Silco,Jayce,You're afraid.
9,Jayce,Silco,I am afraid.
9,Jayce,Silco,"Today, I got a glimpse of what war between us might look like."
9,Jayce,Silco,Your people wouldn't stand a chance.
9,Jayce,Silco,The Council couldn't care less.
9,Jayce,Silco,I'm trying to save you from annihilation.
9,Silco,Jayce,"Well, well."
9,Silco,Jayce,"Not the fresh-faced Academy pledge, are you?"
9,Silco,Jayce,"You want peace, this is the price."
9,Jayce,Silco,You'll discontinue the production of Shimmer?
9,Silco,Jayce,Half there already.
9,Jayce,Silco,Return the Gemstone.
9,Jayce,Silco,And I need Jinx.
9,Jayce,Silco,She has to pay for what she's done.
9,Silco,Jayce,They weren't her crimes. She was working for me.
9,Jayce,Silco,"Believe me, if I had it my way, it'd be you rotting in Stillwater,"
9,Jayce,Silco,but we can't make a deal with a snake and cut off its head.
9,Jayce,Silco,We both have our shitty parts to play.
9,Jayce,Silco,Get me Jinx. And I'll give you your nation of Zaun.
9,Heimerdinger,,Astonishing.
9,Heimerdinger,Ekko,You say all this came about in your own brief lifespan?
9,Heimerdinger,Ekko,How were you able to accomplish so much so quickly?
9,Ekko,Heimerdinger,You'd be surprised what you can pull off when your life depends on it.
9,Heimerdinger,Ekko,"Uh, why this form?"
9,Heimerdinger,Ekko,"Surely, there are more efficient and safer methods of transportation."
9,,,Firelights!
9,,,Huh?
9,,,Hmm?
9,Heimerdinger,Ekko,Oh.
9,Ekko,Heimerdinger,"It's not enough to give people what they need to survive,"
9,Ekko,Heimerdinger,you have to give them what they need to live.
9,Silco,,A thousand times I've imagined this moment.
9,Silco,,Never like this.
9,Silco,,All we ever wanted.
9,Silco,,The boy didn't even haggle.
9,Silco,,And what do I lose but problems?
9,Silco,,"Oh, it all makes sense now, brother."
9,Silco,,Is there anything so undoing as a daughter?
9,,,Damn it.
9,,,Piss off.
9,Sevika,,Everyone out.
9,Vander,Vi,"Well, your guard needs working."
9,Vander,Vi,"I wish I could say it gets easier, kiddo."
9,Vander,Vi,But I'd be lying.
9,Vander,Vi,What I can say is...
9,Vander,Vi,She still needs you.
9,Vander,Vi,They all do.
9,Vander,Vi,So what do you say?
9,Vander,Vi,That's my girl.
9,Vi,,Silco.
9,Jinx,Vi,"Bravo, sis."
9,Jayce,,My recent unsanctioned activities
9,Jayce,,in the underground have shown me two things.
9,Jayce,,I'm not fit to govern the people who live there.
9,Jayce,,And neither are you.
9,Jayce,,"Our opportunity to demonstrate our compassion,"
9,Jayce,,"our dedication,"
9,Jayce,,our solidarity has passed.
9,Jayce,,They're right not to trust us.
9,Mrs. Kiramann,,"You're walking a fine line, Jayce."
9,Jayce,,"With respect, I don't give a shit what any of you think of me anymore."
9,Jayce,Mel,Except you.
9,Jayce,Mel,You were right.
9,Jayce,Mel,You were always right.
9,Jayce,,"My days here are numbered, but I've come with Viktor,"
9,Jayce,,"my partner and a Zaunite, with one final proposal."
9,Viktor,,Jayce has brokered a peace with Silco.
9,Viktor,,In exchange for the undercity's independence.
9,Mrs. Kiramann,,What? Nonsense! We have procedures...
9,Jinx,,Really thought I buried this place.
9,Jinx,,But I should have known better.
9,Vi,Jinx,Powder?
9,Jinx,,Nothing ever stays dead.
9,Vi,Jinx,Are we alone?
9,Jinx,Vi,For now.
9,Jinx,Vi,Maybe forever.
9,Jinx,Vi,Wanna know a secret?
9,Jinx,Vi,"Silco thinks he made Jinx,"
9,Jinx,Vi,with all his rants and his hard-won lessons.
9,Jinx,Vi,"Excise your doubts, Jinx."
9,Jinx,Vi,"Be what they fear, Jinx."
9,Jinx,Vi,Like everything was the same as when Vander left him.
9,Jinx,Vi,But he didn't make Jinx.
9,Jinx,Vi,You did.
9,Vi,Jinx,"I'm sorry, Powder."
9,Vi,Jinx,I never meant to leave you.
9,Jinx,Vi,You never left.
9,Jinx,Vi,I always heard you.
9,Jinx,Vi,"Shadows in the streets, prickles on the back of my neck."
9,Jinx,Vi,Your voice.
9,Jinx,Vi,Pushing me.
9,Jinx,Vi,Picking me up when all the colors were black.
9,Jinx,Vi,You're the reason I'm still alive.
9,Vi,Jinx,I spent so many nights in that shitty prison.
9,Vi,Jinx,"On the freezing floor, hungry, bloody, counting the hours."
9,Vi,Jinx,The only thing...
9,Vi,Jinx,The only thing that kept me going was the thought of getting back to you.
9,Jinx,Vi,Are we still sisters?
9,Vi,Jinx,Nothing is ever going to change that.
9,Jinx,Vi,I always knew you'd come back.
9,Vi,Jinx,What's going on?
9,Silco,,No.
9,Jinx,Vi,He took everything from us.
9,Jinx,Vi,"Right here, he stabbed Vander in the back."
9,Jinx,Vi,Just like he planned to do with me.
9,Jinx,Silco,Liar.
9,Jinx,,Mm. We're missing someone.
9,Vi,,Huh?
9,Jinx,Vi,I paid your girlfriend a visit this morning.
9,Vi,Jinx,What did you do?
9,Jinx,Vi,I made her a snack.
9,Vi,Jinx,Huh?
9,Vi,Jinx,No!
9,Jinx,Vi,Sheesh.
9,Jinx,Vi,I'm not that crazy.
9,Vi,Jinx,Powder! Leave her out of this.
9,Jinx,,Now...
9,Jinx,Vi,Where should I sit?
9,Jinx,Vi,"That's your choice, really."
9,Jinx,Vi,Make her go away. Please.
9,Jinx,Vi,Send her on her way and...
9,Jinx,Vi,And you can have Powder back.
9,Caitlyn,,Mm.
9,Vi,Jinx,I can't.
9,Jinx,,Ah.
9,Vi,Jinx,"No! Powder, listen."
9,Vi,Jinx,We... we can just go.
9,Vi,Jinx,We'll leave and never come back.
9,Jinx,Vi,Where would we go?
9,Jinx,Jinx,"No, no, no. She's not saying that."
9,Vi,Jinx,"It's true, we'll put this behind us."
9,Vi,Jinx,"You'll never have to see him again, Powder."
9,Jinx,Silco,What do you have to say about that?
9,Silco,Vi,Her name is Jinx!
9,Silco,Jinx,She's lying.
9,Silco,Jinx,You'll be with her a day before she realizes
9,Silco,Jinx,you aren't that girl anymore and turns her back on you.
9,Jinx,,Mm-hmm.
9,Jinx,Vi,You aren't lying?
9,Jinx,Vi,You wouldn't lie to me. Not again.
9,Vi,Jinx,I'm not lying.
9,Vi,Jinx,I'm on your side. I promise.
9,Jinx,Jinx,Shut up! We're talking!
9,Silco,Jinx,The topsiders offered me everything.
9,Silco,Jinx,"Independence, a seat at the table."
9,Silco,Jinx,All in return for you.
9,Silco,Jinx,They can all burn.
9,Silco,Jinx,"Everyone betrays us, Jinx. Vander. Her."
9,Silco,Jinx,They will never understand.
9,Silco,Jinx,It's only us.
9,Silco,Jinx,You're my daughter.
9,Silco,Jinx,I'll never forsake you.
9,Caitlyn,Jinx,Drop the gun!
