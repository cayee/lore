Code / Infrastructure:
 done - optimize Docker containers (lots of duplicate code)
 - implement Cloud Formation for Lambda
 - add CloudFront secure cookie
 - make Lambda respond within 30 seconds (or shut it down)

Website:
 done - create a docker container for Lambda (with larger indexes)
 done - change query request from GET to POST
 done - create a server-side session...
 done - ...storing last questions
 - ...storing previous context
 done - create a textfield to easily modify prompts
 - create a textarea to easily modify prompts
 done - update the GUI with an option to chat with two chatbots simultaneously
 done - create logs in order to preserve some Q&A for validation
 - handle bedrock session timeout after 1h
 - add user-controlled session suffix - can be used to handle multiple, independent chats

Loremaster:
 done - give the model the bigger index
 done - try the approach with an index made of different-sized chunks
 do - test prompts with json-formatted sections

Vi & Jinx bots:
 - create input-output sets for fine-tuning
 done - test the approach with dumping all the text in one prompt
 do - add mechanism enabling the conversation between the user and the bot (use memory and trim the answers)

Demo:
 - show the difference between clean Titan usage vs reinforcing it with embeddings
 -? show how subtitles affect how the bot articulates sentences
 -? show how Garen responds differently than Vi

Security:
 - prevent JSON prompt injection
 - prevent uer from injecting Bot: Vi: prefixes
 - prevent user from interfering with the story by manipulating the facts
