Code / Infrastructure:
 done - optimize Docker containers (lots of duplicate code)
 - implement Cloud Formation for Lambda
 - add CloudFront secure cookie

Website:
 done - create a docker container for Lambda (with larger indexes)
 done - change query request from GET to POST
 done - create a server-side session...
 done - ...storing last questions
 - ...storing previous context
 done - create a textfield to easily modify prompts
 done - update the GUI with an option to chat with two chatbots simultaneously
 done - create logs in order to preserve some Q&A for validation
 - handle bedrock session timeout after 1h
 done - add user-controlled session suffix - can be used to handle multiple, independent chats
 - catch error calling bedrock and return gracefully to the app
 done - handle 504 errors - ask for the last answer - manually
 - add background picture based on Vi location

Loremaster:
 done - give the model the bigger index
 done - try the approach with an index made of different-sized chunks
 do - test prompts with json-formatted sections
 - prompt manipulation:
   - storyteller style
   - dialogue between a human and a bot
 create 2 prototypes:
   - use 5 previous contexts for question answering
   - rephrase the last question using the context of the dialogue
 

Vi & Jinx bots:
 - create input-output sets for fine-tuning
 done - test the approach with dumping all the text in one prompt
 do - add mechanism enabling the conversation between the user and the bot (use memory and trim the answers)
 - scenes and acts
 - points for each act (subtasks)

Vi story:
 1) Piltover plaza:
   - Rookie wants to join her on an adventure in the Ecliptic Vaults
 2) Ecliptic Vaults:
   - Rookie and Vi investigate the crime scene
 3) Lanes


Demo:
 - show the difference between clean Titan usage vs reinforcing it with embeddings
 -? show how subtitles affect how the bot articulates sentences
 -? show how Garen responds differently than Vi

Security:
 - prevent JSON prompt injection
 - prevent uer from injecting Bot: Vi: prefixes
 - prevent user from interfering with the story by manipulating the facts

New models:
- Embeddings v2.0 -  "amazon.titan-embed-g1-text-02" (Input vector = 8192, Output vector = 1536)
- Titan XL - "amazon.titan-tg1-xlarge", "maxTokenCount": 8192
